Date of Birth:  [**2103-10-20**]             Sex:   M

Service: NMED

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Right hand weakness, slurred speech.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiography with unsuccessful recanalization of left ICA; pt
received 10 mg t-PA and 0.75 of Abciximab.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 76 year old right-handed male with past medical
history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and
stenting,
chronic renal insufficiency, vertebrobasilar aneurysm,
peripheral
vascular disease, mitral regurgitation status post mitral valve
replacement, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and congestive
heart failure who presented to the [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital 1225**]
Medical
Center on [**2180-10-14**] with right hand weakness and slurred speech.

Patient was in his usual state of health until 14:00 on the day
of admission. At that time, he was writing a letter and noted
that his right hand was weak; he was unable to fully grasp his
pen. He tried to talk to his daughter. His speech was garbled
and
he had difficulty getting words out. He was able to comprehend
speech. Family noted his face was drooping on the right side. He
felt like his gait was weak and unsteady. These symptoms lasted
10 minutes and then resolved. He took an aspirin at home, then
his family took him to the Emergency Department for evaluation.

He arrived in the Emergency Department by 15:00. Initial vitals
of temp 98, HR 72, BP 161/75. His symptoms then recurred, in
that
his right hand dropped his cane. On initial exam in the ED, he
had an NIH stroke scale of 4. He was unable to correctly name
the
year, had right lower facial droop, and decreased sensation to
pin and touch on his right arm and leg.  Finger stick blood
glucose testing was 90. CT head with no acute intracranial
hemorrhage, left vertebrobasilar aneurysm. Initial MRI showed an
area of restricted diffusion in the left subcortical parietal
region in area supplied by superior division of MCA,  absent
left
ICA and poor filling of left MCA with collaterals from right
ACOM. Examination after MRI showed NIH stroke scale of 2 with
right lower facial droop. Due to the improvement in his
symptoms,
small size of stroke, and presence of vertebrobasilar aneurysm,
thrombolysis with tPA was not pursued. He was admitted to the
neurology service.

On initial review of systems, he denied fevers, chills, sweats,
chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, headaches, visual
changes, numbness, weakness, paresthesias, abdominal pain,
dysuria. No recent of history of surgery or trauma.


Past Medical History:
1. Mitral valve replacement with porcine valve, [**2179**]. Course
complicated by respiratory failure.
2. Left vertebrobasilar artery aneurysm found during follow-up
for mitral valve replacement. Failed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**]
as an outpatient for evaluation of aneurysm.
3. Stroke, 20 years ago. Unclear what his symptoms were at that
time, but no residual deficits.
4. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG 5-6 years ago with LIMA to
LAD, SVG to distal circumflex marginal and SVG to PDA. Also with
multiple stents.
5. Congestive heart failure
6. Rectal cancer status post resection with resultant colostomy,
[**2177**] . No history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
7. Hypercholesterolemia
8. Hypertension
9. Gout
10. Status post burn injury to hands as child, status post
grafting
11. MRSA positive

13. Peripheral vascular disease
14. 50-79% left ICA stenosis on ultrasound
15. History of bacterial endocarditis
16. Degenerative joint disease
17. Hypothyroidism

All: Aspirin results in rash, but he reported taking it
nevertheless.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was stable overnight from [**2180-10-14**] to am of [**2180-10-16**]. At
approximately 6am on [**2180-10-16**], noted by nurse to be in
respiratory distress, aphasic, and not moving right side at all.
NIH stroke scale 19. Felt to be in congestive heart failure by
exam and chest x- ray. Treated with IV lasix. Stat head CT
showed no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. Taken for
MRI/MRA. MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion in entire left
MCA territory; lesion not yet visible on FLAIR. Patient was
taken to angiography suite emergently for attempt at
intraarterial tPA thrombolysis. However, left ICA was totally
occluded and unable to access left sided circulation via ACOM.
Neurointerventionalist was able to traverse the left ICA
occlusion and five 10.5 mg of intraarterial tPA and 1mg of
Reopro. Multiple attempts to open left ICA via balloon
angioplasty were undertaken. However, flow was poor and vessel
reoccluded. Post-procedure, patient taken to ICU intubated.

Hospital course has been remarkable for difficulty weaning from
ventilator due to volume overload, difficulty handling
secretions and aspiration pneumonia. He received a course of
levofloxacin and metronidazole for aspiration. He has been
treated with IV Lasix for CHF. He was successfully extubated on
[**2180-10-23**]. He was
transiently on vancomycin for sputum culture with S. aureus.
After extubation, he was tachypneic and had several episodes of
respiratory distress which responded to IV lasix.  He developed
a painful left knee effusion.  Arthrocentesis was performed and
revealed an inflammatory artritis.  Since the patient had been
on antibiotics for PNA, it was immpossible to rule out a
partially treated septic arthritis.  He was therefore treated
with Vancomycin for several days until knee joint fluid culture
was negative.  For inflammation, he was started on IV
methylprednisilone taper, he was changed to po prednisone on the
day of discharge per rheumatology.  His knee was re-tapped x2 by
rheumatology service; both subsequent taps revealed negatively
birefringent crystals c/w gout.
For stroke prevention, he was started on ASA and Aggrenox. He
has been evaluated and treated by PT and OT while in the
hospital, his deficits have remained largely static, but he has
had some improvement in the last several days in terms of
increased speech production and decreasing right neglect.  He
failed swallow evaluation on [**10-26**] and subsequently had a PEG
placed on [**10-30**].  He was seen by the CHF service while in the
hospital for episodes of respiratory distress due to CHF.  He
was started on Lisinopril, lasix and beta blocker.  His
respiratory status has improved.  His echo was technically
limited, but revealed LVH and dilated LA (EF could not be
assessed).  He also had several runs of V tach (longest 42
beats) during his hospitalization.  EP service was [**Month/Year (2) 4221**] and
recommended continuing telemetry, electrolyte repletion and
continuing beta blocker.  He should continue to have cardiac
telemetry while in rehab for the next seven days. Follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in stroke clinic has been arranged for [**1-2**].

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105259**] is a 68 year-old man with ESRD on HD, CAD, COPD.
He was in his usual state of health on [**6-21**] when he was seated
in a chair and he had sudden onset shortness of breath without
chest pain or palpitations. He was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital
on [**6-21**]. There he was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
He was briefly hypotensive in the peri-intubation period,
thought to be secondary to propofol vs. sepsis. For the latter
he was treated briefly with vancomycin and Zosyn. Also under
consideration was that he may have aspirated secondary to
benzodiazepine overdose. He was also treated for a COPD
exacerbation with steroids and nebulizers. He was subsequently
thought to have had flash pulmonary edema secondary to a primary
cardiac event, as below.
.
On his initial EKG, he had precordial ST elevations and T-wave
inversions inferiorly that were thought to be rate related. He
was hypotensive and having an upper GI bleed, so treatment of
acute MI including [**Month/Year (2) **], beta [**Month/Year (2) 7005**], statin, ACEI were
with-held. He was transferred to the ICU wihere EKG showed
resolution of the ST elevation; however, troponin rose to 4.8.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed that no treatment options
for ACS were available as he was not stable for catheterization,
anticoagulation was contraindicated (GI bleed), beta [**Month/Year (2) 7005**]
could not be given because of hypotension, and his ESRD
precluded ACEI.
.
On the second hospital day, the patient became tachycardic to
the 130s and desatruated to 88% on 2L. EKG showed ST depressions
V5/V6. He was given 5 mg IV lopressor in decrease in HR to the
low 100s as well as 1 mg IV ativan. Cardiology was again
consulted, and he was given PO metoprolol such that HR decreased
to the 90s over hours. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema.
Renal was consulted, and he received 80 mg IV furosemide with
diuresis of 250 cc and improvement to 98% O2 Sat on 2L. EKG 3
hours later showed resolution of ST depressions and resolution
of sinus tachycardia. Cardiac enzymes were again cycled.
Troponin I increased to 1.22 8 hours after and subsequently
fell. CK was flat. At no point did he experience chest pain.
.
Upon review of the case, the cardiology consulting service felt
that he because he had inducible ischemia that seemed to be rate
dependent, he was a candidate for non-urgent catheterization.
His beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 81 mg, and statin were restarted prior to
transfer. Echo showed EF 35-45% with mild LV mild hypokinesis,
moderate concentric LVH, and moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
His course was complicated by bright red blood in the NG tube at
the time of intubation. Hct dropped from 48 on admission, to 35
after agressive fluid resuscitation. It was subsequently stable
for several days
.
For his ESRD he underwent HD Tuesday and Thursday and was
maintained net negative.

Pertinent Results:
[**6-25**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system with a ramus branch revealed severe two
vessel disease. The LMCA had mild plaquing but was free of
critical stenoses. The LAD was heavily calcified and diffusely
diseased with mild tapering of the proximal vessel and diffuse
disease extending from D1 and culminating in a 90% stenosis just
before the small D3 branch with post-stenotic dilatation. S1 had
a moderate origin stenosis. The D1 branch was diffusely disease
with a 60% stenosis in the mid-vessel. There were septal
collaterals to the distal RCA system. The moderate caliber LCx
was diffusely diseased, and it was difficult to quantitate the
reference vessel diameter. It supplied small diffusely diseased
OM branches with distal AV groove collaterals to the distal RCA.
The ramus branch was a modest caliber but patent vessel. The RCA
was totally occluded serially in the proximal vessel after some
severe disease and reconstituted distally (RCA, RPL1, RPL2, and
RPDA) via vasa and left to right collaterals. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed normal right heart filling pressures with
a mean RA of 6 mmHg and moderate-severely elevated left heart
filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 19 mmHg and LVEDP of 26
mmHg. There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PASP
of 31mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 3.7 l/min/m2
(using an assumed oxygen consumption). 3. Left ventriculography
was deferred.
[**6-28**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction including hypokinesis of the
basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls, distal
septum and apex. The apex is not aneurysmal (LVEF 40%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
cavity dilation and regional dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.
[**6-30**] CT of Head: Scattered hypodense foci in bilateral occipital
lobes and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, most consistent with
acute/subacute embolic infarcts, superimposed on more chronic
infarction. As the patient is unable to tolerate MRI secondary
to presence of epicardial pacer leads, serial CT examinations
could be performed to assess possible evolution.
[**7-1**] MRI of Head: Innumerable foci of slow diffusion with
associated T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity scattered throughout
the bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. Findings are
consistent with acute-subacute infarcts of multiple etiologies,
including embolic infarcts, watershed infarction, and hypoxic
injury.


Brief Hospital Course:
A 68 year-old man with a history of Coronary Artery Disease,
recently admitted to OSH for hypoxic respiratory failure and
found to have EKG changes in the setting of tachycardia, and
currently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of possible
catheterization.
.
# CORONARIES/Post-op: Patient had ST changes prior to transfer
in the setting of tachycardia that may have been demand related.
 It's less difficult to tease out whether the ischemia was
primary or secondary, but the ST elevations and elevated
troponin were worrisome. Troponins were trending down prior to
transfer. CK have not been elevated. Medical management of CAD
including [**Hospital1 **], statin, beta [**Hospital1 7005**] were continued. He underwent
cardiac catheterization which showed LAD with 50-60% tubular
stenosis with focal 90% lesion in mid-vessel, LCx with diffuse
disease, and a totally occluded proximal RCA with filling
distally via collaterals.  Given 3-vessel CAD, cardiac surgery
was consulted for consideration of CABG. He underwent coronary
artery bypass graft on [**6-29**] without incidence. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Transferred to CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Patient remained
intubated due to unresponsiveness. CT/MRI revealed multiple
infarcts. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed
per protocol. Multiple attempts to wean patient from ventilator
failed d/t neuro status and a tracheostomy was placed [**7-7**]. Tubes
feeds were given throughout post-op course for nutrional support
and PEG was planned for placement on [**7-7**] but not performed
secondary to patient having fevers and increased WBC. PEG tube
was eventually placed on [**7-13**].
.
#Stroke: On post-op day one sedation was weaned and although
patient would open eyes, there was no movement in extremities or
response to commands. Stat CT and neuro consult were preformed.
CT finding were most consistent with acute/subacute embolic
infarcts, superimposed on more chronic infarction. Neurology
felt in addition to embolic infarcts, there was watershed and
ischemic hypoperfusion bilaterally. They felt prognosis of
recovery was poor. Patient eventually regained very limited
movement in extremities and response to commands. Right pupil
larger than left and blinks eyes to questions.
.
# PUMP: Chronic systolic congestive heart failure with EF 35-40%
on recent echo with evidence of LV wall hypokinesis. Per OSH
records, he has a history of flash pulmonary edema in the
setting of hypertensive urgency 03/[**2151**]. He also seems to have
had flash pulmonary edema this admission at the other hospital,
possibly triggered by a cardiac event, as above. On admission to
[**Hospital1 18**], exam and CXR were indicative of euvolemia.
.
# recent hypoxic respiratory failure: His O2 Sat was normal on
room air upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. Post-operatively patient was
unable to be weaned from ventilator and required tracheostomy.
.
# COPD exacerbation: The patient denied a history of COPD,
although this is noted on his OSH records.  He does have a 50
pack-year smoking history, and he was on Combivent and
Tiotropium as an outpatient. He was being treated at the OSH for
COPD exacerbation with nebulizers and steroids. On admission he
was not SOB, wheezing, or hypoxic.  A brief steroid taper was
completed.  He did not require nebulizer treatments.  PFTs done
as part of the pre-operative work-up showed FEV 179% predicted
with FEV1/FVC 114% predicted.
.
# ESRD: Cause was unknown. Tues/Thurs/Sat dialysis was continued
upon admission but changed to Mon/Wed/Friday dialysis after
surgery. Renal followed patient throughout post-op course.
.
# Anxiety and substance abuse: Patient had a history of anxiety
disorder and benzodiazepine over-use.  He was supposed to
discontinue lorazepam as an outpatient, per notes from outside
hospital.  However, he has been receiving lorazepam on transfer
and was actively withdrawing on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], with visual
hallucinations and tremors.  He was started on a CIWA with
diazepam.  He required 10 mg diazepam every 4 hours, and his
hallucinations abated. Diazepam was decreased to 5 mg every 4
hours, and he continued to score high on the CIWA on subjective
measures such as anxiety.  He also was quite demanding about
receiving the diazepam.  The psychiatry consulting service saw
him to assist with addiction and anxiety issues.  At their
recommendation, diazepam with CIWA was stopped, and outpatient
dose of lorazepam resumed.  Sertraline was also restarted.  He
could not receive Seroquel because of borderline long QT at
baseline. Psych consult was performed post-op and stated no
acute psych issues and to continue with neuro/medical
management.
.
# GI: Patient had upper GI bleed with coffee ground NG output at
OSH. He has a history of PUD but no prior bleeds according to
him. HCT on transfer is stable from OSH (35 on transfer) and
remained stable. Post-op patient was incontinent of stool and
urine and remained that way upon discharge.
.
#Infectious disease: Urine with Citrobacter. Sputum with COAG
positive staph. His WBC remained elevated during post-op
fluctuating between 10.5 and 22.8. He received Vanco/Cipro
during post-op. Cipro d/c'd [**7-13**] after repeat urine culture
negative.
.
#Nutrition: Tubefeeding: Nutren Pulmonary Full strength, Goal
rate:50 ml/hr. PEG tube placed [**7-13**].

Chief Complaint:
hematemesis






Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
upper endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 84 yo F w/ h/o GERD, AFib, CAD, COPD, HTN, TIA,
PVD, w/J tube recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 16006**]) with J-tube
dysfunction.  The patient was admitted [**2147-7-10**] because she
awoke and vomited bright red blood two times (each approxmiately
1 cup). In the ED, the patient was afebrile and normotensive.
She was found to be in Afib with rates to the 120s. A NG lavage
showed 150cc coffee grounds, and the patient had melena from
below. Pt. not clearing completely after 500 cc NS and was
transfused 1 Unit. The patients hct was 28 from a baseline of
approximately 30. GI was called and wanted to admit to ICU for
EGD. Also, troponin elevated to 0.06. Per cardiology likely
demand ischemia and recommeneded transfusing PRBC.
.
The patient was in the ICU and her brief hospital course is
listed below.  Her EGD showed friable esophag. mucosa and
[**Last Name (un) **].  For her drop in hct from 28.4-27.7, she was given 2
Units of PRBC and responded appropriately (hct 35.8).  She was
maintained on a PPI, carafate, and her ASA was held per GI
consult.  For her UTI, she was started on bactrim, and had no
issues.  For her afib, her digoxin and metoprolol were held, in
the setting of the GIB.  In addition to the above issues, she
was found to have a troponin leak, but this was attributed to
demand ischemia, and no intervention was required.  The
patient's rheumatoid medications were held during her course as
well.  Finally, per imaging her G tube was found to be displaced
and surgery will be notified.
.
On the floor, the patient denied increased SOB, CP, dizziness,
increased weakness, back pain, suprapubic tenderness.  Unchanged
dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 84 year old female with history of reflux,
atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), COPD,
hypertension, TIA, PVD, who presents with Upper GI bleed due to
esophagitis, and urinary tract infection.
.
1) Upper GI Bleed - The source of the patient's GI bleed was
likely from her friable esophageal mucosa, we continued to
monitor her hematocrit, until it was stable.  Once she was
stable, we restarted her home medications through her GJ tube.
We continued her on a proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **], carafate and
held her ASA.  After being in the ICU, she did not require any
further transfusion.  We stopped her IVF, once she was stable
and she did well with her diet being advanced as tolerated.
.
2) Atrial Fibrillation - The patient was having afib with rate
up to 150's in ED, and up to 120's in ICU.  Once on the floor,
she was not actively bleeding so we restarted her home
medications of digoxin and metoprolol, and maintained her on
telemetry.  She remained stable on these medications, and her
tachycardia improved.
.
3) Troponin Leak - This was likely demand ischemia, in the
setting of a GI bleed, so we continued to check her hematocrit
to keep her stable.  She did well and her tropinins improved.
She would likely benefit from seeing her outpatient cardiologist
once she is out of rehab.
.
4) Urinary tract infection - Her UA was positive, so we sent
urine cultures.  She was started on bactrim, but when her urine
culture was negative we stopped her antibiotic.  She remained
afebrile, and did not have signs of symptoms of infection.
.
5) Coronary artery disease - The patient was stable, and as
above her troponins improved.  Per the GI service, we restarted
her metoprolol and lipitor through her GJ tube.  We held her ACE
and lasix, to avoid hypotension and the patient did well.  Her
aspirin was held due to her bleed and this as well as her ACE
and Lasix should likely be restarted by her primary care
physician.
.
6) Diabetes - We held her home medications of metformin and
glipizide.  She was given sliding scale insulin and had one
episode of hypoglycemia which responded well to half an amp of
dextrose.  She did well once we halved her dose of sliding scale
insulin.
.
7) Rheumatoid arthritis - In the ICU, her hydroxychloroquine,
prednisone and sulfasalazine, were held initially.  She was
stable on the floor, so we restarted these medications through
her GJ tube and she had no problems.
.
8) LUQ tenderness (at GJ site) - The patient had just had her GJ
readjusted, so this was likely normal.  She remained afebrile
and her pain improved, but we notified Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the
physician who placed the tube) about this and the suboptimal
placement of the tube.  No intervention was necessary and the
patient's pain improved.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] said her tenderness is
normal, and both tubes are able to be used.  Her G tube is the
foley and the J tube is the pigtail.
.
9) Nutrition - Patient is tolerating oral diet.  She should
continue this with shake supplements at meals.  If she has
problems, she can be fed through her [**Name (NI) **] tube and this could be
addressed with her outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Fr. [**Known lastname 77811**] is an 88 year old man with esophageal cancer and
aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty. He presented to the ICU with
respiratory failure.
.
##. Sepsis. A CXR was performed on [**6-16**] as part of a fever
work-up and showed new atelectasis and inflammation probably due
to aspiration in left lower lobe. He was started on Unasyn 3gm
q6 on [**6-16**] to cover aspiration which was transitioned to
cefepime [**6-18**] as prelim sensitivities were resistant to
ampicillin. He was then transitioned back to Unasyn on [**6-19**] when
final sensitivities returned. He had blood cultures and sputum
cultures that were positive for Acinetobacter Baumannii. These
were pan-sensitive. His sputum culture later grew aspergillus
and klebsiella. On [**6-23**] he had a worsening of his respiratory
status. He was transferred to the ICU where he was intubated.
His antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin, meropenem, and
eventually voriconazole. He required several liters of fluid to
help maintain his blood pressure. He was intermittently placed
on pressors. He continued to have fevers despite antibiotic
treatment. A CT scan was obtained on [**6-29**] to look for an abscess.
There was no evidence of an abscess. He had large pleural
effusions. He had urine and sputum cultures that both grew out
yeast. No further invasive procedures were planned per the goals
of care discussed with the family. The ID team was following his
hospital course.
.
##. Respiratory Failure: On initial examination Fr. [**Known lastname 77811**] was
grossly overloaded with evidence of edema in the upper and lower
extremities. He was diuresed on the floor.  His low albumin was
thought to be contributing to some 3rd spacing due to a decrease
in his oncotic pressures. On the day of transfer to the ICU he
was intubated for respiratory distress. Several weaning trials
were attempted, but he required more and more ventilator support
throughout the hospitalization. He was unable to be weaned from
the ventilator. A tracheostomy was discussed with the family,
but they did not think this was in the goals of his care. He was
briefly started on furosemide in the ICU, but his blood pressure
would not tolerate it.
.
##. Esophageal cancer. Mr. [**Known lastname 77811**] was scheduled to complete
his course of XRT on [**6-22**]. No treatment was delivered while in
the ICU.
.
##. Malnutrition: Mr. [**Known lastname 77811**] had poor PO intake which was
likely related to his esophageal mass which caused him some
odynophagia. He received tube feeds in the ICU.
.
##. Pulmonary Embolus: On review of the CTA from [**6-22**] radiology
found a subsegmental PE (amended report). He was started on a
heparin gtt.
.
##. Aortic Stenosis: Fr. [**Known lastname 77811**] underwent a repeat echo which
showed his valve area 0.8-1.1. The cardiology service was
consulted for assistance in management of his preload.
.
##. Goals of Care: On admission Fr. [**Known lastname 77811**] was a full code and
aggressive treatment was pursued. In the ICU he was intubated on
admission. As his prognosis worsened, his family decided to
transition to comfort measures only. He was terminally extubated
and passed with his family by his side.

CXR ([**2191-12-31**]):
Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There

has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central
venous catheter, terminating in the very distal SVC, without
evidence of pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube is seen, very distal
difficult to discern, but remains above the level of the carina.
Distal aspect of the nasogastric tube is also not well seen
below the level of the distal esophagus. Lungs remain clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with type 1 diabetes s/p asystolic arrests x 3
likely due to acidosis and hyperkalemia secondary to diabetic
ketoacidosis.  Anion gap was closed with fluids and insulin
drip. Onset thought to be due to acute viral gastroenteritis
leading to his diabetic ketoacidosis. Arctic arrest cooling
protocol initiated for neuro protection after multiple cardiac
arrests.  It was thought that arrests likely secondary to
hyperkalemia vs acidosis.  Pt noted to have elevated troponins
likely secondary to demand ischemia vs NSTEMI vs end organ
damage from his cardiac arrest.  On [**1-2**], pt noted to have
increased temperature, shivering, and increased secretions from
the ET tube.  He was started on antibiotics empirically.  Family
decision was made that pt would be CMO; however he was kept on
the vent until [**1-5**] so that family members could arrive from out
of state.  Extubation occurred on [**1-5**], and pt passed away
approximately 10 minutes later.  Family declined autopsy.

Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty
Bare metal stent placed in SVG-D1


History of Present Illness:
 Patient is an 87 y/o male with PMHx CAD s/p CABG, iCM (EF 35%),
AS who presented to the ED with chest pain, DOE, and a near
syncopal episode prior to presentation.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were Afeb, 68, 134/38, 18, 100%RA. The
patient recieved ASA 325mg x 1.
On the floors, the patient was kept on his home medications. He
underwent a cardiac cath which showed 3 vessel disease as well
as severe aortic stenosis. He was evaluated by Thoracic surgery
for an AVR, however it was decided he would be a better patient
for a valvuloplasty. He underwent valvuloplasty with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**8-3**] where his gradient improved from 65 to 41 mmHg and
increased of CO from 4.39 to 4.8. He also underwent BMS to
SVG-D1. During the procedure he felt abdominal cramps such as if
he were to move his bowels as well as nausea and vomited x1 a
black material that he reports looked like blood. His blood
pressure decreased from 150/46 to 118/46 mmHg. At some point
during procedure, nurse was concerned for a ""seizure"", but
patient was awake and with normal exam when physicians evaluated
him. He was transferred to the CCU for monitoring post
procedure.

REPORTS
CARDIAC CATH [**7-29**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA has no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had a total occlusion in the proximal
portion
of the vessel and a diagonal with an 80% mid vessel stenosis.
The Cx had
a total proximal occlusion. The RCA had a total proximal
occlusion.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 14mmHg and an LVEDP of
21mmHg. The
Pulmonary pressures were moderately elevated with a PASP of
44mmHg. The
cardiac index was preserved at 2.2 l/min/m2. There was a 60mmHg
gradient
from the LV to the aorta on pullback of the catheter. The
central aortic
pressure was noted to be 143/44 mmHg.
3. Limited arterial conduit arteriography revealed an SVG to OMB
that
had a 40-50% ostial stenosis. The SVG to PDA had a 60-70%
stenosis in
the mid portion of the SVG. The RPDA was a very large vessel and

provided collaterals to the Cx distribution. The SVG to Diagonal
had a
90% ostial stenosis with slow flow into the diagonal branch. The

diagonal branch had collateral from the LAD. The LIMA to the LAD
was
widely patent and the LAD was a small vessel in caliber.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.
3. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
CT Chest w/o contrast [**7-29**]
FINDINGS:
The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. The appearance
of the
sternum is unremarkable with no evidence of dehiscence. There
are several
bypass grafts noted, at least two originating from the ascending
aorta.
Descending aorta is normal in diameter, not exceeding 3 cm.
Calcifications
involve the entire ascending aorta and starts approximately 7 cm
above the
aortic valve. The extent of calcification is more pronounced at
the anterior circumference of the aorta than at the posterior
part. There is a small gap between the superior end of the
calcifications and the first bypass graft, approximately 1.5 cm
in diameter. The aortic arch and descending aorta are calcified
as well. The aortic valve is heavily calcified. The diameter of
the pulmonary arteries is unremarkable. Native coronary arteries
are extremely calcified. Heart size is normal. There is a
relative bulging of the cardiac apex that potentially may
represent a prior myocardial infarct of the apex of the left
ventricle. The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates
calcified abdominal aorta, atrophic changes in the pancreas.
Several mediastinal lymph nodes are
not pathologically enlarged. The airways are patent to the level
of subsegmental bronchi bilaterally. Diffuse bronchial wall
thickening is noted, bilaterally, mostly in the upper lungs.
Those findings in conjunction with multiple centrilobular
nodules might be consistent with respiratory bronchiolitis/viral
infection. Superior segment of right lower lobe subpleural
lesion, 4:90, is 10 x 7 mm in diameter and most likely
represents atelectasis, but would require further followup to
exclude the possibility of neoplasm. A right hilar calcified
lymph nodes as well as right lower lobe calcified granuloma are
consistent with prior ranulomatous exposure. Bibasilar linear
opacities most likely representing
areas of atelectasis. Left upper lobe posterior nodule, is 2.5
cm in
diameter, 4:75, a lingular nodule is calcified, 4:113. There is
no pleural or pericardial effusion demonstrated. Extensive
degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine. There
are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive calcifications of the ascending aorta as described
in detail in the body of the report.
2. Status post CABG with at least two bypasses originating from
the ascending aorta.
3. Extensive calcifications of native coronary arteries and
aortic valve.
Questionable prior myocardial infarct involving the left
ventricular apex.
4. Suspected respiratory bronchiolitis/infectious process in the
upper lungs, correlate if history of smoking is present.
5. Superior segment of right lower lobe atelectasis versus
nodule, should be evaluated in three months for documentation of
stability/resolution.

ECHO [**7-30**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 45 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.5 cm2). Mild to moderate
([**12-27**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
Carotid series [**7-30**] Final Report
Study: Carotid Series Complete
Reason:87 year old man s/p CABG, with worsening AS, work-up for
AVR..
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On
the right there is bulky heterogeneous plaque in the ICA and
ECA. On the left there is significant heterogeneous plaque in
the ICA and a tiny plaque in the ECA. Both CCA waveforms are
blunted consistent with know AS.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 93/10, 76/15, 77/17,
cm/sec. CCA peak systolic
velocity is 86 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 107 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.0. These findings are consistent with
<40% stenosis.
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 479/105, 223/39, 144/39, cm/sec. CCA
peak systolic
velocity is 77 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 147 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is 6.2. These findings are consistent with
80-99% stenosis.
There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow. There is
antegrade left vertebral artery flow.
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis 80-99%
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 85550**],
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted
through the emergency department with complaints of chest pain
and difficulty breathing. You described difficulty walking up
stairs and you had a near-fainting episode as well. We believe
these symptoms were due to your history of heart valve disease.
You underwent a heart catheterization procedure on [**7-29**] which
confirmed your heart valve disease.
You were scheduled and taken for repeat catheterization
procedure, this time to fix your valve on [**8-3**]. A bare metal
stent was also placed in one of the blood vessels of your heart.
.
You were also diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus. This will
need to be followed by your primary care physician.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
START Metoprolol Succinate 50mg Daily
START Clopidogrel 75mg daily
INCREASE Aspirin 325mg daily

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9965**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2113-11-6**]: PEG placement by Interventional Radiology
[**2113-11-15**]: Bone biopsy by Orthopedic Surgery
[**2113-11-18**]: PICC Placement

History of Present Illness:
84 y/o female with CHF (EF 20%), MR, TR, recurrent UTI and
panhypopituitarism from [**Doctor Last Name 30762**], severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], and
dementia presents with hypotension and hypoglycemia and
urosepsis.  Per family, patient is interactive and
conversational at baseline, and is able to recognize family. She
has had a slowly progressive decline over the past month. She
resides at [**Hospital3 **] memory care, and is typically
interactive, enjoys music, art, and activities. She has become
very weak, per family, since an [**9-20**] admission for CHF
exacerbation. She was admitted to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 3678**] Hospital,
where she was diuresed and discharged to rehab.  At rehab, she
started gaining weight and retaining fluid. Per daughter, her
weights were not being checked. She was re-admitted to [**Hospital 10287**] for diuresis. She was discharged to rehab about a week
ago with a urinary catheter in place.
.
On Monday [**10-16**], she became agitated per family. Over the 48
hours prior to admission, she has become more lethargic, with
decreased PO intake. Per family, she had not eaten, had food, or
medications for 2-3 days. Per family, patient typically gets
agitated and confused like such with prior UTIs, although
typically it gets caught and treated earlier.  Per rehab notes,
she was started empirically on cefpodoxine for presumed UTI,
although it does not appear patient has received it due to
inability to take PO.  On the day of admission, her providers
found her to be found to have BG 38 and SBPs in 60s. She was
given a half amp of D50, 500 cc of NS, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

.
In the ED patient was unable to follow commands or answer
questions. Initial VS were: 98.4 85 117/60 62 100% 2L. Labs were
notable for WBC of 12.6, (Diff - N 57, Band 0, L 29, M 13*).
Initial lactate was 11.4 (spurious), K was 7.1 and fasting
glucose was 50. Repeat lactate was 2.2 and K was 4.9. U/A showed
RBCs of 27* and WBCs of >182* w/ many bacteria.  Her EKG showed
NSR, LAD, QTC 453 and LBBB (no old for comparison). CXR showed
pleural effusion on left side though underlying consolidation
could not be excluded. She was given hydrocort 100 mg IV x 1, IV
Vanc and Cefepime, 1 liter NS, D10 @ 150cc/hr and calcium
gluconate for hemolyzed hyperkalemia. Urine and blood cultures
were sent. Per family, patient's code status is DNR, but okay
for intubation.
.
In the MICU, urine was found to be growing E.coli, and is
currently on cefepime through PICC line.  CT head showed concern
for ischemic changes.  MRI was obtained and showed chronic
ischemic changes, possibly from frequent hypotension.  Mental
status improved over ICU course, and patient is more conversant
than on admission.  Code status was addressed, and she is
DNR/DNI.  NG tube was placed to start tube feeds.  Patient was
given intermittent Lasix to keep her even to -500 cc per day.
.
On the floor, patient is minimally arousable.  There are no
reported complaints.
.

   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.

   POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2113-11-16**]):
      NO FUNGAL ELEMENTS SEEN.
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. No previous tracing
available for comparison.
.
CXR ([**2113-10-19**]):
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained. The
patient is rotated to the left. Large area of opacification
involving the
right mid to lower lung suggests pleural effusion with overlying
atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. There
is also blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due
to pleural effusion. The left retrocardiac opacity and
obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is seen, may be due to
pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying
consolidation not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes are shifted leftward of midline presumably due to
patient positioning/rotation. Suggest repeat with better
positioning when patient able.

ECHO ([**2113-10-20**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is borderline dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the septum, anterior wall, apex and mid- distal inferior wall
(multivessel CAD). The remaining segments contract appropriately
(LVEF = 25%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2113-10-21**]):
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. No CT evidence of major vascular territory infarct, however,
MRI is more sensitive if clinical suspicion remains high.
3. Pronounced diffuse subcortical white matter hypoattenuation
could
represent severe confluent small vessel ischemic disease, but
raises question of potential ischemic brain injury. Recommend
further assessment with MRI including diffusion imaging.
.
MRI HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2113-10-22**]): The diffuse T2/FLAIR
signal abnormalities in the white matter do not demonstrate
restricted diffusion and indicate diffuse leukoencephalopathy,
which could be due to chronic changes of hypoxia. The changes
are extensive for small vessel ischemic changes. No acute
infarcts are seen. Chronic infarcts in both cerebral hemispheres
are noted. Brain atrophy is seen.
.
KUB SUPINE, ERECT AND LLD ([**2113-10-24**]): One frontal supine and
three right lateral decubitus images show no evidence of free
air. The previously seen air pocket overlying the left upper
quadrant is no longer visible, and likely represented a skinfold
or garment. There is an NG tube, which terminates inside the
stomach. There is paucity of air within the small bowel. There
are no dilated loops of small or large bowel. There is air seen
within the large bowel, extending into the rectum. There is no
evidence of obstruction or ileus. Again noted is an IVC filter
and coils
in the left mid abdomen. There are mild degenerative changes of
L4 and L5.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction, ileus, toxic megacolon,
or free air.
.
[**2113-11-3**] Abd supine and erect:
Three views of the abdomen, including supine views of the upper
and lower abdomen and a left decubitus of the entire abdomen
show no free
subdiaphragmatic gas. Mild distention of the transverse colon
and some loops of small bowel in the mid abdomen do not suggest
mechanical obstruction.  There is formed stool in the rectum.
The patient has two caval umbrella filter and vascular coils in
the left mid abdomen. Thoracic aorta and upper abdominal aorta
are heavily calcified but not focally aneurysmal.
.
[**2113-11-6**] Portable abdomen:
FINDINGS: Single AP view of the abdomen (two images) demonstrate
no evidence for free air or obstruction. An IVC filter and
intravascular coils are noted.  The imaged lung bases are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intra-abdominal process.
.
[**2113-11-6**] Chest x-ray: AP chest compared to [**10-22**] through
21.
Large right pleural effusion has progressed slowly since
[**10-30**]. Also,
increased his moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and
a smaller
left pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascular congestion is present,
but Iwould
not say there is pulmonary edema. Consolidation in the left
lower lobe could be atelectasis or pneumonia. It developed
between [**10-30**] and [**11-3**].  Right PIC line ends in the
mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2113-11-8**]: PEG tube placement
1. Uncomplicated placement of a 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 12433**]
gastrotomy tube. The tube may be used in 24 hours.
2. Moderate amount of air used to insufflate stomach. Patient
may experience
mild transient abdominal distention.
3. IVC filter and embolization coils noted on fluoroscopy.
.
[**2113-11-11**]: Bone Scan
IMPRESSION: Increased uptake in the coccyx on static images
without associated increased blood flow or pool is not classic
for osteomyeltitis, as all three phases would be increased with
active infection. If, however, the patient has been receiving
antibiotics, the blood flow and pool would not necessarily be
increased and the presence of increased uptake on static images
only could indicate chronic, treated osteomyelitis.
.
CXR [**2113-11-18**]: Left sided PICC line terminates at the cavo-atrial
junction. Mild pulmonary edmema and bilateral effusions
unchanged. Known left sided rib fractures not well seen


Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old female with multiple medical problems, including CHF
(EF 20%), severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], panhypopituitarism from [**Doctor Last Name 30762**],
and mild dementia who presents from rehab with hypotension and
altered mental status, found to have urosepsis, with hospital
course complicated by c. diff, hematocrit drop, poor nutritional
status, constipation and coccygeal ulcer.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# UROSEPSIS: patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab where she
was being treated for CHF, had Foley catheter in place.
Presented with altered mental status and agitation, found to be
hypotensive and hypoglycemic with fever and leukocytosis. She
was admitted to the MICU. Received IV fluids, and stress dose
steroids with hydrocortisone 100mg q8 hours given her chronic
prednisone use, hypotension and h/o Sheehans. Urine cultures
showed E. coli UTI sensitive to cefipime. Patient completed 7
day course of IV Cefipime through PICC line. On HD#4, she was
hemodynamically stable and transferred to the floor. On HD#22,
she had repeat UCx during episode of worsening mental status,
which showed 10,000-100,000 colonies cefipime-sensitive E. coli
and was thought to be a colonizer. Repeat urine culture on [**11-11**]
was also showed a Ecoli with 10,000-100,000 CFU/mL. Pt will
remain with foley in place given extensive sacral wound. Would
suggest changing foley every 3 weeks to prevent further
colonization of resistant organisms.
.
# C. DIFFICILE: patient found to have positive C. diff toxin on
[**10-23**]. She was treated with Vancomycin 125mg PO q6 hours and
Flagyl 500mg IV q8 hours. Flagyl was discontinued after 5 days
of treatment when pt's WBC count returned to [**Location 213**] and
resolution of loose stool, but next day loose stool returned and
mental status worsened so Flagyl was restarted. Her leukocytosis
and loose stool again resolved. Patient completed a 14-day
course of oral vancomycin (last day [**2113-11-8**]) and a 12-day
course of IV metronidazole (last day [**2113-11-9**]). Given that
patient, was restarted on ertapenem for sacral osteomyelitis.
Would continue for 10 days after finishing ertapenem course.
.
# HEMATOCRIT DROP: patient had two [**6-17**] point HCT drops during
hospitalization, and guaiac positive stools throughout.
Transfused one unit pRBC during second HCT drop, with good
response. Presumed cause is lower GI bleeding [**1-11**] C. diff vs.
stress ulcer. Patient has h/o stress ulcer after past hip
surgery, and also received stress dose steroids in ICU.
Considered TTP and other causes of hemolytic anemia but
hemolysis labs negative. She was continued on PPI, heparin and
ASA discontinued. HCT remained stable after this.
.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
progressively deteriorating mental status x 1 month. Several
potential etiologies. First, she has baseline dementia, with MRI
head showing diffuse chronic leukoencephalopathy, brain atrophy
and chronic BL cerebellar infarcts (no acute processes). In
addition, her UTI and C. diff worsened her mental status
acutely. She had pain secondary to a sacral pressure ulcer
during hospitalization, which also contributed to AMS; morphine
also caused her to become lethargic. Also some contribution of
hospital delirium. With improved nutritional status and limited
use of narcotics, patient's mental status drastically improved.
.
# NUTRITION: patient initially started on NG tube feeds during
hospitalization. However, she pulled her NG tube numerous times.
PO was attempted but patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, so concern for aspiration risk. On HD#15, had goals of
care conversation with family wherein it was decided that she
would start temporary TPN with goal of bridging to G tube and
ultimately back to PO. On [**2113-11-8**], she had a PEG tube placed by
Interventional Radiology and was subsequently weaned off of TPN.
 Patient was followed by nutrition and speech/swallow throughout
hospitalization. Monitored for signs of refeeding syndrome with
no issues.
.
# CONSTIPATION: Patient had significant constipation secondary
to poor PO intake and opiate pain medicine use during this
admission.  Abdominal x-rays were negative for bowel
obstruction.  Her constipation improved with oral stool
softeners/laxatives, suppositories and enemas.
.
# SACRAL PRESSURE ULCER: patient had stage III sacral pressure
ulcer which worsened during hospitalization. Received two wound
care consults and daily dressing changes.  Out of concern for
osteomyelitis, a bone scan was done.  This showed some evidence
of chronic osteomyelitis.  Bone biopsy grew rare E. coli and
Enterococcus, but was also not convincing for osteomyelitis.  It
was thought that infection was mainly limited to soft tissue
surrounding the ulcer.  Patient began treatment with ertapenem
500 mg IV Daily, which would cover empirically for any resistant
organisms as well.  Pain controlled with prn morphine, lidocaine
patch and tylenol. Patient given supplemental vitamins per
nutrition recs to accelerate wound healing. She will remain on
ertapenem for 2-3 weeks. If there is significant improvement,
she potentially would need to remain on antibiotics for 6 weeks.
However this decision will need to be collectively made with
wound care and ID. Weekly ESR/CRP, CBC, electrolytes will need
to be monitored.
.
# CHRONIC CHF: patient has chronic systolic CHF with EF 25% and
severe AR, MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. On Lasix 40mg PO daily at home which was
restarted after urosepsis was treated. Titration of lasix should
continue to maintain euvolemic state.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# LOW PLATELETS: patient has h/o ITP, baseline platelets ~60s.
Platelet count has fluctuated during hospitalization. Was 145 on
admission, acutely dropping to 75 on HD#6. DDx initially
included ITP flare [**1-11**] infection, HIT, DIC and hemodilution. Had
negative DIC labs. CBC showed large platelets, consistent with
ITP. Continued on heparin with no further drop in platelets.
Patient followed as outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for her ITP.
.
# PANHYPOPITUITARISM: Free T4 low on admission, however unclear
whether pt had been taking home dose levothyroxine in setting of
recent infection and poor PO intake. Levothyroxine continued.
For adrenal insufficiency, pt on prednisone 5mg daily (home dose
5-10mg daily). TSH was rechecked and normal during admission.
.
# GERD: continued home lansoprazole.
.
# CAD: discontinued home ASA secondary to GI bleeding. Continued
statin.
.
# DEPRESSION: continued home paxil.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 12279**],

It was a pleasure participating in your care at [**Hospital1 771**]. You were admitted to the hospital with
low blood pressure and altered mental status, and were found to
have a urinary tract infection (urosepsis).  After completing
antibiotics for your urinary tract infection, you developed
Clostridium difficile colitis, for which you were treated with
vancomycin and Flagyl.  During your admission, you were not
eating enough to support your body.  Because of this, a
percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed so that you can have
extra nutrition from tube feeds.  You were also treated for an
ulcer on your backside with possible surrounding infection
during this admission.

Please note, the following changes have been made to your
medications:
- STOP omeprazole
- STOP cefpodozime
- STOP roxanol
- STOP aldactone
- STOP aspirin
- STOP captopril
- STOP coreg
- START lansoprazole dissolving tablet 30 mg by mouth daily
- START Tylenol 1000 mg by mouth three times per day
- START lidocaine patch 5% applied to back daily
- START ertapenem 500 mg intravenous daily through [**2113-12-9**]
- START Flagyl 500mg by mouth every 8 hours until you are
finished with the ertapenem
- TAKE oxycodone 2.5-5mg by mouth as needed

Please continue all of your other medications as you had prior
to admission.

Wishing you all the best!

Followup Instructions:
The primary doctor at your rehabilitation facility will follow
up with you.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2129-2-17**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2129-2-16**]
CHEST, PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT: Comparison is made to two days
earlier. There is unchanged dilatation of the proximal
esophagus. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
The pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again superimposed on known
underlying bibasilar interstitial abnormalities are
consolidations in the right middle, lower and left lower lobes.
Consolidations in the right lung are more extensive than before.
Otherwise, no significant change.

IMPRESSINO: Findings most consistent with multifocal pneumonia,
including more extensive consolidation in the right middle and
lower lobes.


Brief Hospital Course:
MULTIFOCAL PNEUMONIA CAUSING SEVERE SEPSIS / SEPTIC SHOCK
RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Ms. [**Known lastname 108374**] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the medical service with
dyspnea and fever, initially concerning for COPD exacerbation vs
pneumonia. On the floor, she triggered for desaturation and was
transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Her respiratory
status was tenuous and she was intubated. CXR showed multifocal
pneumonia. She underwent bronchoalveolar lavage that was
low-yield, and no definite organism was cultured.

For her sepsis physiology, she required IV fluid boluses. A
central line was inserted for CVP monitoring and vasopressor
access. She was treated with norepinephrine, and the dobutamine
for borderline low mixed venous O2 sats, both eventually weaned.
 She had a protracted intensive care unit stay, and had
difficulty being weaned off of the ventilator.

She was eventually able to be extubated, but the following day
desaturated and thereafter had to require a non-rebreather mask.
She consciously made the decision that she did not want to be
reintubated and wanted the mask off. Her family including
daughter who was HCP, and another daughter, granddaughter, and
son-in-law were present with her for this decision. She wished
to be made comfort measures only, and NRB was removed. She was
started on morphine  gtt for comfort. She subsequently expired.

ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
The patient developed acute renal failure in the setting of
sepsis. She was maintained on fluid and vasopressor/inotropic
support.

Chief Complaint:
Right hand weakness, slurred speech.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiography with unsuccessful recanalization of left ICA; pt
received 10 mg t-PA and 0.75 of Abciximab.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 76 year old right-handed male with past medical
history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and
stenting,
chronic renal insufficiency, vertebrobasilar aneurysm,
peripheral
vascular disease, mitral regurgitation status post mitral valve
replacement, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and congestive
heart failure who presented to the [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital 1225**]
Medical
Center on [**2180-10-14**] with right hand weakness and slurred speech.

Patient was in his usual state of health until 14:00 on the day
of admission. At that time, he was writing a letter and noted
that his right hand was weak; he was unable to fully grasp his
pen. He tried to talk to his daughter. His speech was garbled
and
he had difficulty getting words out. He was able to comprehend
speech. Family noted his face was drooping on the right side. He
felt like his gait was weak and unsteady. These symptoms lasted
10 minutes and then resolved. He took an aspirin at home, then
his family took him to the Emergency Department for evaluation.

He arrived in the Emergency Department by 15:00. Initial vitals
of temp 98, HR 72, BP 161/75. His symptoms then recurred, in
that
his right hand dropped his cane. On initial exam in the ED, he
had an NIH stroke scale of 4. He was unable to correctly name
the
year, had right lower facial droop, and decreased sensation to
pin and touch on his right arm and leg.  Finger stick blood
glucose testing was 90. CT head with no acute intracranial
hemorrhage, left vertebrobasilar aneurysm. Initial MRI showed an
area of restricted diffusion in the left subcortical parietal
region in area supplied by superior division of MCA,  absent
left
ICA and poor filling of left MCA with collaterals from right
ACOM. Examination after MRI showed NIH stroke scale of 2 with
right lower facial droop. Due to the improvement in his
symptoms,
small size of stroke, and presence of vertebrobasilar aneurysm,
thrombolysis with tPA was not pursued. He was admitted to the
neurology service.

On initial review of systems, he denied fevers, chills, sweats,
chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, headaches, visual
changes, numbness, weakness, paresthesias, abdominal pain,
dysuria. No recent of history of surgery or trauma.


Past Medical History:
1. Mitral valve replacement with porcine valve, [**2179**]. Course

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was stable overnight from [**2180-10-14**] to am of [**2180-10-16**]. At
approximately 6am on [**2180-10-16**], noted by nurse to be in
respiratory distress, aphasic, and not moving right side at all.
NIH stroke scale 19. Felt to be in congestive heart failure by
exam and chest x- ray. Treated with IV lasix. Stat head CT
showed no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. Taken for
MRI/MRA. MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion in entire left
MCA territory; lesion not yet visible on FLAIR. Patient was
taken to angiography suite emergently for attempt at
intraarterial tPA thrombolysis. However, left ICA was totally
occluded and unable to access left sided circulation via ACOM.
Neurointerventionalist was able to traverse the left ICA
occlusion and five 10.5 mg of intraarterial tPA and 1mg of
Reopro. Multiple attempts to open left ICA via balloon
angioplasty were undertaken. However, flow was poor and vessel
reoccluded. Post-procedure, patient taken to ICU intubated.

Hospital course has been remarkable for difficulty weaning from
ventilator due to volume overload, difficulty handling
secretions and aspiration pneumonia. He received a course of
levofloxacin and metronidazole for aspiration. He has been
treated with IV Lasix for CHF. He was successfully extubated on
[**2180-10-23**]. He was
transiently on vancomycin for sputum culture with S. aureus.
After extubation, he was tachypneic and had several episodes of
respiratory distress which responded to IV lasix.  He developed
a painful left knee effusion.  Arthrocentesis was performed and
revealed an inflammatory artritis.  Since the patient had been
on antibiotics for PNA, it was immpossible to rule out a
partially treated septic arthritis.  He was therefore treated
with Vancomycin for several days until knee joint fluid culture
was negative.  For inflammation, he was started on IV
methylprednisilone taper, he was changed to po prednisone on the
day of discharge per rheumatology.  His knee was re-tapped x2 by
rheumatology service; both subsequent taps revealed negatively
birefringent crystals c/w gout.
For stroke prevention, he was started on ASA and Aggrenox. He
has been evaluated and treated by PT and OT while in the
hospital, his deficits have remained largely static, but he has
had some improvement in the last several days in terms of
increased speech production and decreasing right neglect.  He
failed swallow evaluation on [**10-26**] and subsequently had a PEG
placed on [**10-30**].  He was seen by the CHF service while in the
hospital for episodes of respiratory distress due to CHF.  He
was started on Lisinopril, lasix and beta blocker.  His
respiratory status has improved.  His echo was technically
limited, but revealed LVH and dilated LA (EF could not be
assessed).  He also had several runs of V tach (longest 42
beats) during his hospitalization.  EP service was [**Month/Year (2) 4221**] and
recommended continuing telemetry, electrolyte repletion and
continuing beta blocker.  He should continue to have cardiac
telemetry while in rehab for the next seven days. Follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in stroke clinic has been arranged for [**1-2**].

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105259**] is a 68 year-old man with ESRD on HD, CAD, COPD.
He was in his usual state of health on [**6-21**] when he was seated
in a chair and he had sudden onset shortness of breath without
chest pain or palpitations. He was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital
on [**6-21**]. There he was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
He was briefly hypotensive in the peri-intubation period,
thought to be secondary to propofol vs. sepsis. For the latter
he was treated briefly with vancomycin and Zosyn. Also under
consideration was that he may have aspirated secondary to
benzodiazepine overdose. He was also treated for a COPD
exacerbation with steroids and nebulizers. He was subsequently
thought to have had flash pulmonary edema secondary to a primary
cardiac event, as below.
.
On his initial EKG, he had precordial ST elevations and T-wave
inversions inferiorly that were thought to be rate related. He
was hypotensive and having an upper GI bleed, so treatment of
acute MI including [**Month/Year (2) **], beta [**Month/Year (2) 7005**], statin, ACEI were
with-held. He was transferred to the ICU wihere EKG showed
resolution of the ST elevation; however, troponin rose to 4.8.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed that no treatment options
for ACS were available as he was not stable for catheterization,
anticoagulation was contraindicated (GI bleed), beta [**Month/Year (2) 7005**]
could not be given because of hypotension, and his ESRD
precluded ACEI.
.
On the second hospital day, the patient became tachycardic to
the 130s and desatruated to 88% on 2L. EKG showed ST depressions
V5/V6. He was given 5 mg IV lopressor in decrease in HR to the
low 100s as well as 1 mg IV ativan. Cardiology was again
consulted, and he was given PO metoprolol such that HR decreased
to the 90s over hours. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema.
Renal was consulted, and he received 80 mg IV furosemide with
diuresis of 250 cc and improvement to 98% O2 Sat on 2L. EKG 3
hours later showed resolution of ST depressions and resolution
of sinus tachycardia. Cardiac enzymes were again cycled.
Troponin I increased to 1.22 8 hours after and subsequently
fell. CK was flat. At no point did he experience chest pain.
.
Upon review of the case, the cardiology consulting service felt
that he because he had inducible ischemia that seemed to be rate
dependent, he was a candidate for non-urgent catheterization.
His beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 81 mg, and statin were restarted prior to
transfer. Echo showed EF 35-45% with mild LV mild hypokinesis,
moderate concentric LVH, and moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
His course was complicated by bright red blood in the NG tube at
the time of intubation. Hct dropped from 48 on admission, to 35
after agressive fluid resuscitation. It was subsequently stable
for several days
.
For his ESRD he underwent HD Tuesday and Thursday and was
maintained net negative.

Pertinent Results:
[**6-25**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system with a ramus branch revealed severe two
vessel disease. The LMCA had mild plaquing but was free of
critical stenoses. The LAD was heavily calcified and diffusely
diseased with mild tapering of the proximal vessel and diffuse
disease extending from D1 and culminating in a 90% stenosis just
before the small D3 branch with post-stenotic dilatation. S1 had
a moderate origin stenosis. The D1 branch was diffusely disease
with a 60% stenosis in the mid-vessel. There were septal
collaterals to the distal RCA system. The moderate caliber LCx
was diffusely diseased, and it was difficult to quantitate the
reference vessel diameter. It supplied small diffusely diseased
OM branches with distal AV groove collaterals to the distal RCA.
The ramus branch was a modest caliber but patent vessel. The RCA
was totally occluded serially in the proximal vessel after some
severe disease and reconstituted distally (RCA, RPL1, RPL2, and
RPDA) via vasa and left to right collaterals. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed normal right heart filling pressures with
a mean RA of 6 mmHg and moderate-severely elevated left heart
filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 19 mmHg and LVEDP of 26
mmHg. There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PASP
of 31mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 3.7 l/min/m2
(using an assumed oxygen consumption). 3. Left ventriculography
was deferred.
[**6-28**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction including hypokinesis of the
basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls, distal
septum and apex. The apex is not aneurysmal (LVEF 40%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
cavity dilation and regional dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.
[**6-30**] CT of Head: Scattered hypodense foci in bilateral occipital
lobes and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, most consistent with
acute/subacute embolic infarcts, superimposed on more chronic
infarction. As the patient is unable to tolerate MRI secondary
to presence of epicardial pacer leads, serial CT examinations
could be performed to assess possible evolution.
[**7-1**] MRI of Head: Innumerable foci of slow diffusion with
associated T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity scattered throughout
the bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. Findings are
consistent with acute-subacute infarcts of multiple etiologies,
including embolic infarcts, watershed infarction, and hypoxic
injury.


Brief Hospital Course:
A 68 year-old man with a history of Coronary Artery Disease,
recently admitted to OSH for hypoxic respiratory failure and
found to have EKG changes in the setting of tachycardia, and
currently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of possible
catheterization.
.
# CORONARIES/Post-op: Patient had ST changes prior to transfer
in the setting of tachycardia that may have been demand related.
 It's less difficult to tease out whether the ischemia was
primary or secondary, but the ST elevations and elevated
troponin were worrisome. Troponins were trending down prior to
transfer. CK have not been elevated. Medical management of CAD
including [**Hospital1 **], statin, beta [**Hospital1 7005**] were continued. He underwent
cardiac catheterization which showed LAD with 50-60% tubular
stenosis with focal 90% lesion in mid-vessel, LCx with diffuse
disease, and a totally occluded proximal RCA with filling
distally via collaterals.  Given 3-vessel CAD, cardiac surgery
was consulted for consideration of CABG. He underwent coronary
artery bypass graft on [**6-29**] without incidence. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Transferred to CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Patient remained
intubated due to unresponsiveness. CT/MRI revealed multiple
infarcts. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed
per protocol. Multiple attempts to wean patient from ventilator
failed d/t neuro status and a tracheostomy was placed [**7-7**]. Tubes
feeds were given throughout post-op course for nutrional support
and PEG was planned for placement on [**7-7**] but not performed
secondary to patient having fevers and increased WBC. PEG tube
was eventually placed on [**7-13**].
.
#Stroke: On post-op day one sedation was weaned and although
patient would open eyes, there was no movement in extremities or
response to commands. Stat CT and neuro consult were preformed.
CT finding were most consistent with acute/subacute embolic
infarcts, superimposed on more chronic infarction. Neurology
felt in addition to embolic infarcts, there was watershed and
ischemic hypoperfusion bilaterally. They felt prognosis of
recovery was poor. Patient eventually regained very limited
movement in extremities and response to commands. Right pupil
larger than left and blinks eyes to questions.
.
# PUMP: Chronic systolic congestive heart failure with EF 35-40%
on recent echo with evidence of LV wall hypokinesis. Per OSH
records, he has a history of flash pulmonary edema in the
setting of hypertensive urgency 03/[**2151**]. He also seems to have
had flash pulmonary edema this admission at the other hospital,
possibly triggered by a cardiac event, as above. On admission to
[**Hospital1 18**], exam and CXR were indicative of euvolemia.
.
# recent hypoxic respiratory failure: His O2 Sat was normal on
room air upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. Post-operatively patient was
unable to be weaned from ventilator and required tracheostomy.
.
# COPD exacerbation: The patient denied a history of COPD,
although this is noted on his OSH records.  He does have a 50
pack-year smoking history, and he was on Combivent and
Tiotropium as an outpatient. He was being treated at the OSH for
COPD exacerbation with nebulizers and steroids. On admission he
was not SOB, wheezing, or hypoxic.  A brief steroid taper was
completed.  He did not require nebulizer treatments.  PFTs done
as part of the pre-operative work-up showed FEV 179% predicted
with FEV1/FVC 114% predicted.
.
# ESRD: Cause was unknown. Tues/Thurs/Sat dialysis was continued
upon admission but changed to Mon/Wed/Friday dialysis after
surgery. Renal followed patient throughout post-op course.
.
# Anxiety and substance abuse: Patient had a history of anxiety
disorder and benzodiazepine over-use.  He was supposed to
discontinue lorazepam as an outpatient, per notes from outside
hospital.  However, he has been receiving lorazepam on transfer
and was actively withdrawing on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], with visual
hallucinations and tremors.  He was started on a CIWA with
diazepam.  He required 10 mg diazepam every 4 hours, and his
hallucinations abated. Diazepam was decreased to 5 mg every 4
hours, and he continued to score high on the CIWA on subjective
measures such as anxiety.  He also was quite demanding about
receiving the diazepam.  The psychiatry consulting service saw
him to assist with addiction and anxiety issues.  At their
recommendation, diazepam with CIWA was stopped, and outpatient
dose of lorazepam resumed.  Sertraline was also restarted.  He
could not receive Seroquel because of borderline long QT at
baseline. Psych consult was performed post-op and stated no
acute psych issues and to continue with neuro/medical
management.
.
# GI: Patient had upper GI bleed with coffee ground NG output at
OSH. He has a history of PUD but no prior bleeds according to
him. HCT on transfer is stable from OSH (35 on transfer) and
remained stable. Post-op patient was incontinent of stool and
urine and remained that way upon discharge.
.
#Infectious disease: Urine with Citrobacter. Sputum with COAG
positive staph. His WBC remained elevated during post-op
fluctuating between 10.5 and 22.8. He received Vanco/Cipro
during post-op. Cipro d/c'd [**7-13**] after repeat urine culture
negative.
.
#Nutrition: Tubefeeding: Nutren Pulmonary Full strength, Goal
rate:50 ml/hr. PEG tube placed [**7-13**].

On [**7-15**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] felt Mr. [**Known lastname 105259**] was ready for discharge

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
upper endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 84 yo F w/ h/o GERD, AFib, CAD, COPD, HTN, TIA,
PVD, w/J tube recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 16006**]) with J-tube
dysfunction.  The patient was admitted [**2147-7-10**] because she
awoke and vomited bright red blood two times (each approxmiately
1 cup). In the ED, the patient was afebrile and normotensive.
She was found to be in Afib with rates to the 120s. A NG lavage
showed 150cc coffee grounds, and the patient had melena from
below. Pt. not clearing completely after 500 cc NS and was
transfused 1 Unit. The patients hct was 28 from a baseline of
approximately 30. GI was called and wanted to admit to ICU for
EGD. Also, troponin elevated to 0.06. Per cardiology likely
demand ischemia and recommeneded transfusing PRBC.
.
The patient was in the ICU and her brief hospital course is
listed below.  Her EGD showed friable esophag. mucosa and
[**Last Name (un) **].  For her drop in hct from 28.4-27.7, she was given 2
Units of PRBC and responded appropriately (hct 35.8).  She was
maintained on a PPI, carafate, and her ASA was held per GI
consult.  For her UTI, she was started on bactrim, and had no
issues.  For her afib, her digoxin and metoprolol were held, in
the setting of the GIB.  In addition to the above issues, she
was found to have a troponin leak, but this was attributed to
demand ischemia, and no intervention was required.  The
patient's rheumatoid medications were held during her course as
well.  Finally, per imaging her G tube was found to be displaced
and surgery will be notified.
.
On the floor, the patient denied increased SOB, CP, dizziness,
increased weakness, back pain, suprapubic tenderness.  Unchanged
dysuria.

.
[**2147-4-28**] ECHO (most recent):
1.The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
2.There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Though the views are limited, it appears that there might be a
small area of distal septal hypokinesis.[Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 84 year old female with history of reflux,
atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), COPD,
hypertension, TIA, PVD, who presents with Upper GI bleed due to
esophagitis, and urinary tract infection.
.
1) Upper GI Bleed - The source of the patient's GI bleed was
likely from her friable esophageal mucosa, we continued to
monitor her hematocrit, until it was stable.  Once she was
stable, we restarted her home medications through her GJ tube.
We continued her on a proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **], carafate and
held her ASA.  After being in the ICU, she did not require any
further transfusion.  We stopped her IVF, once she was stable
and she did well with her diet being advanced as tolerated.
.
2) Atrial Fibrillation - The patient was having afib with rate
up to 150's in ED, and up to 120's in ICU.  Once on the floor,
she was not actively bleeding so we restarted her home
medications of digoxin and metoprolol, and maintained her on
telemetry.  She remained stable on these medications, and her
tachycardia improved.
.
3) Troponin Leak - This was likely demand ischemia, in the
setting of a GI bleed, so we continued to check her hematocrit
to keep her stable.  She did well and her tropinins improved.
She would likely benefit from seeing her outpatient cardiologist
once she is out of rehab.
.
4) Urinary tract infection - Her UA was positive, so we sent
urine cultures.  She was started on bactrim, but when her urine
culture was negative we stopped her antibiotic.  She remained
afebrile, and did not have signs of symptoms of infection.
.
5) Coronary artery disease - The patient was stable, and as
above her troponins improved.  Per the GI service, we restarted
her metoprolol and lipitor through her GJ tube.  We held her ACE
and lasix, to avoid hypotension and the patient did well.  Her
aspirin was held due to her bleed and this as well as her ACE
and Lasix should likely be restarted by her primary care
physician.
.
6) Diabetes - We held her home medications of metformin and
glipizide.  She was given sliding scale insulin and had one
episode of hypoglycemia which responded well to half an amp of
dextrose.  She did well once we halved her dose of sliding scale
insulin.
.
7) Rheumatoid arthritis - In the ICU, her hydroxychloroquine,
prednisone and sulfasalazine, were held initially.  She was
stable on the floor, so we restarted these medications through
her GJ tube and she had no problems.
.
8) LUQ tenderness (at GJ site) - The patient had just had her GJ
readjusted, so this was likely normal.  She remained afebrile
and her pain improved, but we notified Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the
physician who placed the tube) about this and the suboptimal
placement of the tube.  No intervention was necessary and the
patient's pain improved.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] said her tenderness is
normal, and both tubes are able to be used.  Her G tube is the
foley and the J tube is the pigtail.
.
9) Nutrition - Patient is tolerating oral diet.  She should
continue this with shake supplements at meals.  If she has
problems, she can be fed through her [**Name (NI) **] tube and this could be
addressed with her outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Fr. [**Known lastname 77811**] is an 88 year old man with esophageal cancer and
aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty. He presented to the ICU with
respiratory failure.
.
##. Sepsis. A CXR was performed on [**6-16**] as part of a fever
work-up and showed new atelectasis and inflammation probably due
to aspiration in left lower lobe. He was started on Unasyn 3gm
q6 on [**6-16**] to cover aspiration which was transitioned to
cefepime [**6-18**] as prelim sensitivities were resistant to
ampicillin. He was then transitioned back to Unasyn on [**6-19**] when
final sensitivities returned. He had blood cultures and sputum
cultures that were positive for Acinetobacter Baumannii. These
were pan-sensitive. His sputum culture later grew aspergillus
and klebsiella. On [**6-23**] he had a worsening of his respiratory
status. He was transferred to the ICU where he was intubated.
His antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin, meropenem, and
eventually voriconazole. He required several liters of fluid to
help maintain his blood pressure. He was intermittently placed
on pressors. He continued to have fevers despite antibiotic
treatment. A CT scan was obtained on [**6-29**] to look for an abscess.
There was no evidence of an abscess. He had large pleural
effusions. He had urine and sputum cultures that both grew out
yeast. No further invasive procedures were planned per the goals
of care discussed with the family. The ID team was following his
hospital course.
.
##. Respiratory Failure: On initial examination Fr. [**Known lastname 77811**] was
grossly overloaded with evidence of edema in the upper and lower
extremities. He was diuresed on the floor.  His low albumin was
thought to be contributing to some 3rd spacing due to a decrease
in his oncotic pressures. On the day of transfer to the ICU he
was intubated for respiratory distress. Several weaning trials
were attempted, but he required more and more ventilator support
throughout the hospitalization. He was unable to be weaned from
the ventilator. A tracheostomy was discussed with the family,
but they did not think this was in the goals of his care. He was
briefly started on furosemide in the ICU, but his blood pressure
would not tolerate it.
.
##. Esophageal cancer. Mr. [**Known lastname 77811**] was scheduled to complete
his course of XRT on [**6-22**]. No treatment was delivered while in
the ICU.
.
##. Malnutrition: Mr. [**Known lastname 77811**] had poor PO intake which was
likely related to his esophageal mass which caused him some
odynophagia. He received tube feeds in the ICU.
.
##. Pulmonary Embolus: On review of the CTA from [**6-22**] radiology
found a subsegmental PE (amended report). He was started on a
heparin gtt.
.
##. Aortic Stenosis: Fr. [**Known lastname 77811**] underwent a repeat echo which
showed his valve area 0.8-1.1. The cardiology service was
consulted for assistance in management of his preload.
.
##. Goals of Care: On admission Fr. [**Known lastname 77811**] was a full code and
aggressive treatment was pursued. In the ICU he was intubated on
admission. As his prognosis worsened, his family decided to
transition to comfort measures only. He was terminally extubated
and passed with his family by his side.

Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There

has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central
venous catheter, terminating in the very distal SVC, without
evidence of pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube is seen, very distal
difficult to discern, but remains above the level of the carina.
Distal aspect of the nasogastric tube is also not well seen
below the level of the distal esophagus. Lungs remain clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with type 1 diabetes s/p asystolic arrests x 3
likely due to acidosis and hyperkalemia secondary to diabetic
ketoacidosis.  Anion gap was closed with fluids and insulin
drip. Onset thought to be due to acute viral gastroenteritis
leading to his diabetic ketoacidosis. Arctic arrest cooling
protocol initiated for neuro protection after multiple cardiac
arrests.  It was thought that arrests likely secondary to
hyperkalemia vs acidosis.  Pt noted to have elevated troponins
likely secondary to demand ischemia vs NSTEMI vs end organ
damage from his cardiac arrest.  On [**1-2**], pt noted to have
increased temperature, shivering, and increased secretions from
the ET tube.  He was started on antibiotics empirically.  Family
decision was made that pt would be CMO; however he was kept on
the vent until [**1-5**] so that family members could arrive from out
of state.  Extubation occurred on [**1-5**], and pt passed away
approximately 10 minutes later.  Family declined autopsy.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty
Bare metal stent placed in SVG-D1


History of Present Illness:
 Patient is an 87 y/o male with PMHx CAD s/p CABG, iCM (EF 35%),
AS who presented to the ED with chest pain, DOE, and a near
syncopal episode prior to presentation.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were Afeb, 68, 134/38, 18, 100%RA. The
patient recieved ASA 325mg x 1.
On the floors, the patient was kept on his home medications. He
underwent a cardiac cath which showed 3 vessel disease as well
as severe aortic stenosis. He was evaluated by Thoracic surgery
for an AVR, however it was decided he would be a better patient
for a valvuloplasty. He underwent valvuloplasty with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**8-3**] where his gradient improved from 65 to 41 mmHg and
increased of CO from 4.39 to 4.8. He also underwent BMS to
SVG-D1. During the procedure he felt abdominal cramps such as if
he were to move his bowels as well as nausea and vomited x1 a
black material that he reports looked like blood. His blood
pressure decreased from 150/46 to 118/46 mmHg. At some point
during procedure, nurse was concerned for a ""seizure"", but
patient was awake and with normal exam when physicians evaluated
him. He was transferred to the CCU for monitoring post
procedure.

REPORTS
CARDIAC CATH [**7-29**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA has no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had a total occlusion in the proximal
portion
of the vessel and a diagonal with an 80% mid vessel stenosis.
The Cx had
a total proximal occlusion. The RCA had a total proximal
occlusion.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 14mmHg and an LVEDP of
21mmHg. The
Pulmonary pressures were moderately elevated with a PASP of
44mmHg. The
cardiac index was preserved at 2.2 l/min/m2. There was a 60mmHg
gradient
from the LV to the aorta on pullback of the catheter. The
central aortic
pressure was noted to be 143/44 mmHg.
3. Limited arterial conduit arteriography revealed an SVG to OMB
that
had a 40-50% ostial stenosis. The SVG to PDA had a 60-70%
stenosis in
the mid portion of the SVG. The RPDA was a very large vessel and

provided collaterals to the Cx distribution. The SVG to Diagonal
had a
90% ostial stenosis with slow flow into the diagonal branch. The

diagonal branch had collateral from the LAD. The LIMA to the LAD
was
widely patent and the LAD was a small vessel in caliber.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.
3. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
CT Chest w/o contrast [**7-29**]
FINDINGS:
The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. The appearance
of the
sternum is unremarkable with no evidence of dehiscence. There
are several
bypass grafts noted, at least two originating from the ascending
aorta.
Descending aorta is normal in diameter, not exceeding 3 cm.
Calcifications
involve the entire ascending aorta and starts approximately 7 cm
above the
aortic valve. The extent of calcification is more pronounced at
the anterior circumference of the aorta than at the posterior
part. There is a small gap between the superior end of the
calcifications and the first bypass graft, approximately 1.5 cm
in diameter. The aortic arch and descending aorta are calcified
as well. The aortic valve is heavily calcified. The diameter of
the pulmonary arteries is unremarkable. Native coronary arteries
are extremely calcified. Heart size is normal. There is a
relative bulging of the cardiac apex that potentially may
represent a prior myocardial infarct of the apex of the left
ventricle. The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates
calcified abdominal aorta, atrophic changes in the pancreas.
Several mediastinal lymph nodes are
not pathologically enlarged. The airways are patent to the level
of subsegmental bronchi bilaterally. Diffuse bronchial wall
thickening is noted, bilaterally, mostly in the upper lungs.
Those findings in conjunction with multiple centrilobular
nodules might be consistent with respiratory bronchiolitis/viral
infection. Superior segment of right lower lobe subpleural
lesion, 4:90, is 10 x 7 mm in diameter and most likely
represents atelectasis, but would require further followup to
exclude the possibility of neoplasm. A right hilar calcified
lymph nodes as well as right lower lobe calcified granuloma are
consistent with prior ranulomatous exposure. Bibasilar linear
opacities most likely representing
areas of atelectasis. Left upper lobe posterior nodule, is 2.5
cm in
diameter, 4:75, a lingular nodule is calcified, 4:113. There is
no pleural or pericardial effusion demonstrated. Extensive
degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine. There
are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive calcifications of the ascending aorta as described
in detail in the body of the report.
2. Status post CABG with at least two bypasses originating from
the ascending aorta.
3. Extensive calcifications of native coronary arteries and
aortic valve.
Questionable prior myocardial infarct involving the left
ventricular apex.
4. Suspected respiratory bronchiolitis/infectious process in the
upper lungs, correlate if history of smoking is present.
5. Superior segment of right lower lobe atelectasis versus
nodule, should be evaluated in three months for documentation of
stability/resolution.

ECHO [**7-30**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 45 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.5 cm2). Mild to moderate
([**12-27**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
Carotid series [**7-30**] Final Report
Study: Carotid Series Complete
Reason:87 year old man s/p CABG, with worsening AS, work-up for
AVR..
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On
the right there is bulky heterogeneous plaque in the ICA and
ECA. On the left there is significant heterogeneous plaque in
the ICA and a tiny plaque in the ECA. Both CCA waveforms are
blunted consistent with know AS.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 93/10, 76/15, 77/17,
cm/sec. CCA peak systolic
velocity is 86 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 107 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.0. These findings are consistent with
<40% stenosis.
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 479/105, 223/39, 144/39, cm/sec. CCA
peak systolic
velocity is 77 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 147 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is 6.2. These findings are consistent with
80-99% stenosis.
There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow. There is
antegrade left vertebral artery flow.
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis 80-99%
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 85550**],
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted
through the emergency department with complaints of chest pain
and difficulty breathing. You described difficulty walking up
stairs and you had a near-fainting episode as well. We believe
these symptoms were due to your history of heart valve disease.
You underwent a heart catheterization procedure on [**7-29**] which
confirmed your heart valve disease.
You were scheduled and taken for repeat catheterization
procedure, this time to fix your valve on [**8-3**]. A bare metal
stent was also placed in one of the blood vessels of your heart.
.
You were also diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus. This will
need to be followed by your primary care physician.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
START Metoprolol Succinate 50mg Daily
START Clopidogrel 75mg daily
INCREASE Aspirin 325mg daily
STOP Aspirin 81mg daily
STOP Metoprolol tartrate
CONTINUE Lasix 40mg daily
CONTINUE Ramipril 2.5mg daily
CONTINUE Zocor 40mg daily

weights were not being checked. She was re-admitted to [**Hospital 10287**] for diuresis. She was discharged to rehab about a week
ago with a urinary catheter in place.
.
On Monday [**10-16**], she became agitated per family. Over the 48
hours prior to admission, she has become more lethargic, with
decreased PO intake. Per family, she had not eaten, had food, or
medications for 2-3 days. Per family, patient typically gets
agitated and confused like such with prior UTIs, although
typically it gets caught and treated earlier.  Per rehab notes,
she was started empirically on cefpodoxine for presumed UTI,
although it does not appear patient has received it due to
inability to take PO.  On the day of admission, her providers
found her to be found to have BG 38 and SBPs in 60s. She was
given a half amp of D50, 500 cc of NS, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

.
In the ED patient was unable to follow commands or answer
questions. Initial VS were: 98.4 85 117/60 62 100% 2L. Labs were
notable for WBC of 12.6, (Diff - N 57, Band 0, L 29, M 13*).
Initial lactate was 11.4 (spurious), K was 7.1 and fasting
glucose was 50. Repeat lactate was 2.2 and K was 4.9. U/A showed
RBCs of 27* and WBCs of >182* w/ many bacteria.  Her EKG showed
NSR, LAD, QTC 453 and LBBB (no old for comparison). CXR showed
pleural effusion on left side though underlying consolidation
could not be excluded. She was given hydrocort 100 mg IV x 1, IV
Vanc and Cefepime, 1 liter NS, D10 @ 150cc/hr and calcium
gluconate for hemolyzed hyperkalemia. Urine and blood cultures
were sent. Per family, patient's code status is DNR, but okay
for intubation.
.
In the MICU, urine was found to be growing E.coli, and is
currently on cefepime through PICC line.  CT head showed concern
for ischemic changes.  MRI was obtained and showed chronic
ischemic changes, possibly from frequent hypotension.  Mental
status improved over ICU course, and patient is more conversant
than on admission.  Code status was addressed, and she is
DNR/DNI.  NG tube was placed to start tube feeds.  Patient was
given intermittent Lasix to keep her even to -500 cc per day.
.
On the floor, patient is minimally arousable.  There are no
reported complaints.

   ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):

   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.

   POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2113-11-16**]):
      NO FUNGAL ELEMENTS SEEN.
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. No previous tracing
available for comparison.
.
CXR ([**2113-10-19**]):
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained. The
patient is rotated to the left. Large area of opacification
involving the
right mid to lower lung suggests pleural effusion with overlying
atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. There
is also blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due
to pleural effusion. The left retrocardiac opacity and
obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is seen, may be due to
pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying
consolidation not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes are shifted leftward of midline presumably due to
patient positioning/rotation. Suggest repeat with better
positioning when patient able.

ECHO ([**2113-10-20**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is borderline dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the septum, anterior wall, apex and mid- distal inferior wall
(multivessel CAD). The remaining segments contract appropriately
(LVEF = 25%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2113-10-21**]):
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. No CT evidence of major vascular territory infarct, however,
MRI is more sensitive if clinical suspicion remains high.
3. Pronounced diffuse subcortical white matter hypoattenuation
could
represent severe confluent small vessel ischemic disease, but
raises question of potential ischemic brain injury. Recommend
further assessment with MRI including diffusion imaging.
.
MRI HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2113-10-22**]): The diffuse T2/FLAIR
signal abnormalities in the white matter do not demonstrate
restricted diffusion and indicate diffuse leukoencephalopathy,
which could be due to chronic changes of hypoxia. The changes
are extensive for small vessel ischemic changes. No acute
infarcts are seen. Chronic infarcts in both cerebral hemispheres
are noted. Brain atrophy is seen.
.
KUB SUPINE, ERECT AND LLD ([**2113-10-24**]): One frontal supine and
three right lateral decubitus images show no evidence of free
air. The previously seen air pocket overlying the left upper
quadrant is no longer visible, and likely represented a skinfold
or garment. There is an NG tube, which terminates inside the
stomach. There is paucity of air within the small bowel. There
are no dilated loops of small or large bowel. There is air seen
within the large bowel, extending into the rectum. There is no
evidence of obstruction or ileus. Again noted is an IVC filter
and coils
in the left mid abdomen. There are mild degenerative changes of
L4 and L5.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction, ileus, toxic megacolon,
or free air.
.
[**2113-11-3**] Abd supine and erect:
Three views of the abdomen, including supine views of the upper
and lower abdomen and a left decubitus of the entire abdomen
show no free
subdiaphragmatic gas. Mild distention of the transverse colon
and some loops of small bowel in the mid abdomen do not suggest
mechanical obstruction.  There is formed stool in the rectum.
The patient has two caval umbrella filter and vascular coils in
the left mid abdomen. Thoracic aorta and upper abdominal aorta
are heavily calcified but not focally aneurysmal.
.
[**2113-11-6**] Portable abdomen:
FINDINGS: Single AP view of the abdomen (two images) demonstrate
no evidence for free air or obstruction. An IVC filter and
intravascular coils are noted.  The imaged lung bases are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intra-abdominal process.
.
[**2113-11-6**] Chest x-ray: AP chest compared to [**10-22**] through
21.
Large right pleural effusion has progressed slowly since
[**10-30**]. Also,
increased his moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and
a smaller
left pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascular congestion is present,
but Iwould
not say there is pulmonary edema. Consolidation in the left
lower lobe could be atelectasis or pneumonia. It developed
between [**10-30**] and [**11-3**].  Right PIC line ends in the
mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2113-11-8**]: PEG tube placement
1. Uncomplicated placement of a 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 12433**]
gastrotomy tube. The tube may be used in 24 hours.
2. Moderate amount of air used to insufflate stomach. Patient
may experience
mild transient abdominal distention.
3. IVC filter and embolization coils noted on fluoroscopy.
.
[**2113-11-11**]: Bone Scan
IMPRESSION: Increased uptake in the coccyx on static images
without associated increased blood flow or pool is not classic
for osteomyeltitis, as all three phases would be increased with
active infection. If, however, the patient has been receiving
antibiotics, the blood flow and pool would not necessarily be
increased and the presence of increased uptake on static images
only could indicate chronic, treated osteomyelitis.
.
CXR [**2113-11-18**]: Left sided PICC line terminates at the cavo-atrial
junction. Mild pulmonary edmema and bilateral effusions
unchanged. Known left sided rib fractures not well seen


Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old female with multiple medical problems, including CHF
(EF 20%), severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], panhypopituitarism from [**Doctor Last Name 30762**],
and mild dementia who presents from rehab with hypotension and
altered mental status, found to have urosepsis, with hospital
course complicated by c. diff, hematocrit drop, poor nutritional
status, constipation and coccygeal ulcer.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# UROSEPSIS: patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab where she
was being treated for CHF, had Foley catheter in place.
Presented with altered mental status and agitation, found to be
hypotensive and hypoglycemic with fever and leukocytosis. She
was admitted to the MICU. Received IV fluids, and stress dose
steroids with hydrocortisone 100mg q8 hours given her chronic
prednisone use, hypotension and h/o Sheehans. Urine cultures
showed E. coli UTI sensitive to cefipime. Patient completed 7
day course of IV Cefipime through PICC line. On HD#4, she was
hemodynamically stable and transferred to the floor. On HD#22,
she had repeat UCx during episode of worsening mental status,
which showed 10,000-100,000 colonies cefipime-sensitive E. coli
and was thought to be a colonizer. Repeat urine culture on [**11-11**]
was also showed a Ecoli with 10,000-100,000 CFU/mL. Pt will
remain with foley in place given extensive sacral wound. Would
suggest changing foley every 3 weeks to prevent further
colonization of resistant organisms.
.
# C. DIFFICILE: patient found to have positive C. diff toxin on
[**10-23**]. She was treated with Vancomycin 125mg PO q6 hours and
Flagyl 500mg IV q8 hours. Flagyl was discontinued after 5 days
of treatment when pt's WBC count returned to [**Location 213**] and
resolution of loose stool, but next day loose stool returned and
mental status worsened so Flagyl was restarted. Her leukocytosis
and loose stool again resolved. Patient completed a 14-day
course of oral vancomycin (last day [**2113-11-8**]) and a 12-day
course of IV metronidazole (last day [**2113-11-9**]). Given that
patient, was restarted on ertapenem for sacral osteomyelitis.
Would continue for 10 days after finishing ertapenem course.
.
# HEMATOCRIT DROP: patient had two [**6-17**] point HCT drops during
hospitalization, and guaiac positive stools throughout.
Transfused one unit pRBC during second HCT drop, with good
response. Presumed cause is lower GI bleeding [**1-11**] C. diff vs.
stress ulcer. Patient has h/o stress ulcer after past hip
surgery, and also received stress dose steroids in ICU.
Considered TTP and other causes of hemolytic anemia but
hemolysis labs negative. She was continued on PPI, heparin and
ASA discontinued. HCT remained stable after this.
.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
progressively deteriorating mental status x 1 month. Several
potential etiologies. First, she has baseline dementia, with MRI
head showing diffuse chronic leukoencephalopathy, brain atrophy
and chronic BL cerebellar infarcts (no acute processes). In
addition, her UTI and C. diff worsened her mental status
acutely. She had pain secondary to a sacral pressure ulcer
during hospitalization, which also contributed to AMS; morphine
also caused her to become lethargic. Also some contribution of
hospital delirium. With improved nutritional status and limited
use of narcotics, patient's mental status drastically improved.
.
# NUTRITION: patient initially started on NG tube feeds during
hospitalization. However, she pulled her NG tube numerous times.
PO was attempted but patient with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, so concern for aspiration risk. On HD#15, had goals of
care conversation with family wherein it was decided that she
would start temporary TPN with goal of bridging to G tube and
ultimately back to PO. On [**2113-11-8**], she had a PEG tube placed by
Interventional Radiology and was subsequently weaned off of TPN.
 Patient was followed by nutrition and speech/swallow throughout
hospitalization. Monitored for signs of refeeding syndrome with
no issues.
.
# CONSTIPATION: Patient had significant constipation secondary
to poor PO intake and opiate pain medicine use during this
admission.  Abdominal x-rays were negative for bowel
obstruction.  Her constipation improved with oral stool
softeners/laxatives, suppositories and enemas.
.
# SACRAL PRESSURE ULCER: patient had stage III sacral pressure
ulcer which worsened during hospitalization. Received two wound
care consults and daily dressing changes.  Out of concern for
osteomyelitis, a bone scan was done.  This showed some evidence
of chronic osteomyelitis.  Bone biopsy grew rare E. coli and
Enterococcus, but was also not convincing for osteomyelitis.  It
was thought that infection was mainly limited to soft tissue
surrounding the ulcer.  Patient began treatment with ertapenem
500 mg IV Daily, which would cover empirically for any resistant
organisms as well.  Pain controlled with prn morphine, lidocaine
patch and tylenol. Patient given supplemental vitamins per
nutrition recs to accelerate wound healing. She will remain on
ertapenem for 2-3 weeks. If there is significant improvement,
she potentially would need to remain on antibiotics for 6 weeks.
However this decision will need to be collectively made with
wound care and ID. Weekly ESR/CRP, CBC, electrolytes will need
to be monitored.
.
# CHRONIC CHF: patient has chronic systolic CHF with EF 25% and
severe AR, MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. On Lasix 40mg PO daily at home which was
restarted after urosepsis was treated. Titration of lasix should
continue to maintain euvolemic state.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# LOW PLATELETS: patient has h/o ITP, baseline platelets ~60s.
Platelet count has fluctuated during hospitalization. Was 145 on
admission, acutely dropping to 75 on HD#6. DDx initially
included ITP flare [**1-11**] infection, HIT, DIC and hemodilution. Had
negative DIC labs. CBC showed large platelets, consistent with
ITP. Continued on heparin with no further drop in platelets.
Patient followed as outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for her ITP.
.
# PANHYPOPITUITARISM: Free T4 low on admission, however unclear
whether pt had been taking home dose levothyroxine in setting of
recent infection and poor PO intake. Levothyroxine continued.
For adrenal insufficiency, pt on prednisone 5mg daily (home dose
5-10mg daily). TSH was rechecked and normal during admission.
.
# GERD: continued home lansoprazole.
.
# CAD: discontinued home ASA secondary to GI bleeding. Continued
statin.
.
# DEPRESSION: continued home paxil.
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 12279**],

It was a pleasure participating in your care at [**Hospital1 771**]. You were admitted to the hospital with
low blood pressure and altered mental status, and were found to
have a urinary tract infection (urosepsis).  After completing
antibiotics for your urinary tract infection, you developed
Clostridium difficile colitis, for which you were treated with
vancomycin and Flagyl.  During your admission, you were not
eating enough to support your body.  Because of this, a
percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed so that you can have
extra nutrition from tube feeds.  You were also treated for an
ulcer on your backside with possible surrounding infection
during this admission.

Please note, the following changes have been made to your
medications:
- STOP omeprazole
- STOP cefpodozime
- STOP roxanol
- STOP aldactone
- STOP aspirin
- STOP captopril
- STOP coreg
- START lansoprazole dissolving tablet 30 mg by mouth daily
- START Tylenol 1000 mg by mouth three times per day
- START lidocaine patch 5% applied to back daily
- START ertapenem 500 mg intravenous daily through [**2113-12-9**]
- START Flagyl 500mg by mouth every 8 hours until you are
finished with the ertapenem
- TAKE oxycodone 2.5-5mg by mouth as needed

Please continue all of your other medications as you had prior
to admission.

Wishing you all the best!

Followup Instructions:
The primary doctor at your rehabilitation facility will follow
up with you.
- You will also follow up with the infectious disease doctors.
If you do not hear from them on Monday [**2113-11-20**], please call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 91249**] and ask to be connected to the [**Hospital **] clinic to make an

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 108374**] is an 83 y/o F with PMH of CAD, COPD, bronchoalveolar
lung cancer s/p wedge resection in [**2121**] admitted on [**2-14**] with
subjective fever/chills X 10 days and found to have multifocal
pneumonia. Prior to admission, she noted cough productive of
yellow sputum and shortness of breath (new for her). She was
noted to be 86% on RA on arrival to the ED with low grade fever
to 100.3. Her O2 sats improved to 98% on 3L NC. In the ED, she
received methylprednisolone, albuterol/atrovent and was treated
with ceftriaxone/azithromycin (after blood cultures drawn).
.
On arrival to the medical floor, the patient was stable on 3 L
NC. On the morning of [**2-16**], triggered for worsening hypoxia,
tachycardia, which improved with nebulizers. Oxygen requirement
did increase to 4 L over the course of the day. Triggered again
at 2200 for hypoxia; vancomycin was added at that time. After
midnight, developed acute shortness of breath with hypoxia to
the 80s on 70% face mask. NRB applied with oxygen saturations
88-92%. Patient tachypneic and tachycardic at the time. No chest
pain. Suctioning revealed small amount of thin pink secretions.
ABG revealed 7.49/34/61. Called by floor team to eval patient at
that time.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2129-2-17**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2129-2-16**]
CHEST, PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT: Comparison is made to two days
earlier. There is unchanged dilatation of the proximal
esophagus. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
The pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again superimposed on known
underlying bibasilar interstitial abnormalities are
consolidations in the right middle, lower and left lower lobes.
Consolidations in the right lung are more extensive than before.
Otherwise, no significant change.

IMPRESSINO: Findings most consistent with multifocal pneumonia,
including more extensive consolidation in the right middle and
lower lobes.


Brief Hospital Course:
MULTIFOCAL PNEUMONIA CAUSING SEVERE SEPSIS / SEPTIC SHOCK
RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Ms. [**Known lastname 108374**] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the medical service with
dyspnea and fever, initially concerning for COPD exacerbation vs
pneumonia. On the floor, she triggered for desaturation and was
transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Her respiratory
status was tenuous and she was intubated. CXR showed multifocal
pneumonia. She underwent bronchoalveolar lavage that was
low-yield, and no definite organism was cultured.

For her sepsis physiology, she required IV fluid boluses. A
central line was inserted for CVP monitoring and vasopressor
access. She was treated with norepinephrine, and the dobutamine
for borderline low mixed venous O2 sats, both eventually weaned.
 She had a protracted intensive care unit stay, and had
difficulty being weaned off of the ventilator.

She was eventually able to be extubated, but the following day
desaturated and thereafter had to require a non-rebreather mask.
She consciously made the decision that she did not want to be
reintubated and wanted the mask off. Her family including
daughter who was HCP, and another daughter, granddaughter, and
son-in-law were present with her for this decision. She wished
to be made comfort measures only, and NRB was removed. She was
started on morphine  gtt for comfort. She subsequently expired.

ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
The patient developed acute renal failure in the setting of
sepsis. She was maintained on fluid and vasopressor/inotropic
support.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a 61 year old man with severe systolic CHF
(EF 15-20%), HTN, DM2 who presents with rectal pain. He states
that he has had 5 years of intermittent rectal pain following a
colonscopy that diagnosed internal hemorrhoids. He states that 5
days ago he had worsened rectal pain that was worsened with
bowel movements. He has seen small amounts of blood in his stool
over this time. He was seen by his PCP 2 days ago who prescribed
anusol. His pain progressed and was referred to the ED yesterday
by his PCP.
.
In the ED his initial vitals were 98.8 85 144/83 18 94%RA. A
rectal exam showed L glutteal area/perirectal area +erythema,
tender, fluctuant, +pus; L rectal wall tender. A CT pelvis
showed a large peri-rectal abscess. I&D was done. General
Surgery was consulted who recommended conservative therapy as
the lesion was already draining. His ED course was complicated
by hypotension with a nadir sbp to 73/50. He did receive single
doses of diluadid and morphine for rectal pain ~1 hour prior to
hypotension starting. Sepsis protocol was started. He received
vanc/unasyn. A RIJ was placed. He received a total of 1.5 liters
of crystalloid. Blood, urine, swab cultures were taken. Initial
lactate was 2.4 with repeat 1.2.
.
ROS at admission: denies cough, chest pain, abd pain. breathing
is at baseline. mild dysuria since rectal pain started.
.
In the MICU, pt's pressures stabilized s/p IVF and 1 unit RBCs.
His Hct stabilized at 28 and nadir at 23 believed to be [**3-1**]
abscess drainage. He was continued on vancomycin and unasyn for
likely MRSA/MSSA, cultures pending.  Blood cultures remained
negative.  Pt also c/o new L knee pain c/w gouty pain.  NSAIDs
held given CKD and recent decr Hct, he is taking colchicine.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P The patient is a 61 male with severe systolic CHF EF 15%,
DM2, CKD presenting with rectal pain found to have a peri-rectal
abscess complicated by hypotension, also with worsening left
knee pain
.
# Peri-rectal abscess/fever: The patient was evaluated by the
surgical service and had an incision and drainage of the
abscess.  He was intially started on vancomycin and unasyn, but
when the cultures came back negative for MRSA, he was only
continued on Unasyn.  The patient's LFTs began to rise during
his hospitalization, and it was thought to be due to the Unasyn.
 It was discontinued, and he was started on Levofloxacin and
Metronidazole until discharge.  He completed his course of
antibiotics by the time of discharge.  At discharge, he was
afebrile.  His hospital course was also initially complicated by
hypotension in the ED with SBP in the 70s.  It was unclear
whether this was sepsis vs narcotic induced hypotension, and the
patient was transferred to the MICU.  He had a central line
placed and blood cultures were negative for organisms.  His BP
quickly returned to [**Location 213**], and then he was hypertensive
requiring his medications again.  He was then transferred to the
floor.  He never required pressors.  The patient had CT scans
which showed no evidence of colitis on admission.  After
discharge from the MICU and onto the floor, he continued to
spike fevers occasionally despite the Unasyn, and it was unclear
whether it was from the abscess or from his gout flare.  A
repeat CT showed improvement in the perirectal abscess, and the
surgical service and wound care nurses continued to dress the
wound.  At the time of discharge, the patient's rectal pain had
markedly improved, and he was no longer febrile, and having
bowel movements without difficulty.
.
# LFT Elevation: The patient has baseline mild transaminitis
which was thought to be due to congestive hepatopathy from prior
GI evaluations.  During this hospitalization, the patient's LFTs
acutely increased, and a Hepatology consult was placed. Cardiac
enzymes were negative, and ECG was unchanged.  RUQ ultrasound
did not show biliary dilation, but rather hepative venous
dilatation.  They felt that the elevation was likely due to the
Unasyn on top of the baseline congestive hepatopathy, therefore
the patient was diuresed, and his antiobiotics were changed.  At
discharge, his LFTs were trending downwards.  He will followup
in Liver clinic for further evaluation and possibly a liver
biopsy in the future.
.
# Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia thought to be due to
chronic disease.  He was transfused 1 unit pRBC during MICU
course for Hct trend 30 --> 23 --> 28.  Baseline Hct 30-35 with
low-nl MCV.  He then had another acute Hct drop to 21.6, but
then a repeat Hct was 26.  He was given a unit of pRBCs at that
time as well.  Hemolysis labs were negative, and the patient was
continued on a ppi for GI bleed.  A GI consult was placed since
the patient had guiaiac positive stools.  They felt that an EGD
and colonscopy would benefit the patient, but since he had an
active perirectal abscess and an INR>2.0, this will be done as
an outpatient in 1 week from discharge.  He has followup in GI
for EGD next Thursday and Colonscopy in 7 weeks. His HCT at
discharge was 33.
.
# Left Knee Pain: The patient has a history of gout, and his
left knee pain was consistent with prior gout flares.
Rheumatology was consulted since the patient had underlying
kidney disease and an active infection therefore NSAIDs and
steroids were contraindicated.  A arthocentesis was performed
which showed monosodium urate crystals and was negative for
septic arthritis.  He was continued on colchicine and narcotics
for pain control, and at the time of discharge, his knee pain
had improved.  He will continue on the colchicine and oxycodone
PRN for pain control, and he will have a f/u appt with
rheumatology to decide if allopurinol should be started in the
outpatient setting.
.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient's EF is approx 15%.
 He was euvolemic to hypervolemic on exam without evidence of
acute ischemia or decompensation. Pt has ICD in place.  He was
continued on digoxin and carvedilol throughout this
hospitalization.  He was also diuresed given his congestive
hepatopathy and acute kidney injury both thought to be due to
poor forward flow from decompensated heart failure.  With
diureses, the patient's symptoms and kidney function markedly
improved. He will continue his coreg, lasix, and digoxin and
will f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in heart failure clinic.
.
# Acute Kidney Injury on CKD 3: The patient's Cr at baseline
(1.4 - 1.6) with est GFR ~50.  During this hospitalization, his
creatinine increased to 2.0.  This was felt to be due to poor
forward flow from her heart failure.  With diuresis, her
creatinine improved and at discharge was down to 1.1.  He will
continue his current medications and f/u with his PCP for
further evaluation of his kidney function.  His colchicine is
currently dosed daily given that his Creatinine clearance has
improved, but may need to be changed to Q48 if his creatinine
increases to >1.4.  The patient should avoid NSAIDs for his gout
given his kidney disease.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient's was rate controlled
throughout this admission.  Initially, the coumadin was held in
setting of supratherapeutic INR and Hct drop.  He was then
restarted on coumadin, but he became supratherpeutic again in
the setting of acute liver injury due to unasyn and congestive
hepatopathy.  The coumadin was again held, and the patient's INR
was monitored.  His INR should be <1.7 for his EGD next
Thursday.  Once his INR is <2.0, he should be bridged with
Lovenox 100 mg Q12H assuming his CrCl>50, otherwise, the lovenox
should not be started.  Also, it should be held the morning of
his EGD, and then restarted that evening while restarting
coumadin at 3 mg QHS until his INR is [**3-2**].  The patient will
need f/u with his PCP to ensure his INR is therapeutic on this
coumadin regimen.
.
# Hypotension: Initially the patient had an episode of
hypotension prior to admission to the MICU.  THis was felt to be
due to narcotics.  During the rest of his admission, this was
not [**Last Name **] problem.  [**Name (NI) **] will continue his hypertensive medicaitons
at discharge.
.
# Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia was felt to be due to
his volume status. As he was diuresed, his sodium improved.  The
patient was restarted on his Lasix 80 mg daily dose and this can
be adjusted for his volume status.  The patient will need f/u
with his PCP and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] (cardiologist) for further changes to
this regimen.
- Continue to monitor Na: 135->133
.
# R renal mass: The patient had a renal mass seen on u/s,
measuring 2.3cm, not noted on prior exams. They recommended MRI
but patient has ICD. The patient will need an outpatient CT to
further characterize and evaluate for changes in size.
.
# DM2: The patient will continue 70/30 15 units Qam and 8 units
QPM with a humulog insulin sliding scale as needed.
.

.
# Dispo: The patient will be discharged to a rehabilitation
facility.  He will have an EGD on [**1-16**] and a colonscopy in 7
weeks after discharge.  He has followup with rheumatology,
hepatology, and his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] INR and Hct should be checked
every 2 days while he is at rehab.  A phone call should be
placed to the GI office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 463**] with his [**2177-1-15**] INR to
determine if it would be safe for him to have his EGD.  If his
INR<2.0, he should be bridged with lovenox as outlined above
assuming his creatinine clearance is >50. The patient also was
discharged with a foley catheter as he was unable to urinate
twice after removal of catheter.  Prior to discharge, bladder
training was started, and should be continued in rehab with the
goal of foley catheter removal.  Prior to admission, the patient
did not have a catheter in place

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Blood transfusion (2 Units)


History of Present Illness:
Reason for MICU transfer:  hypotension requiring pressors

81 year old male with h/o CHF (EF 20%), CAD s/p CABG in [**2166**],
afib on warfarin, VT s/p ICD placement, GI bleed secondary to
?NSAID use, peripheral vascular disease s/p right SFA stent last

week, ?dementia, presented with SOB.

In the ED, initial VS were:  08:02 0 97.8 83 92/74 18 98%.  He
triggered for BP 60s. Physical exam was notable for red blood on

rectal examination.  Labs were notable for Hct 26 (at discharge
[**7-3**] was 27.5), INR 2, Cr 1.9 (baseline 1.5). Also trop 0.61
with ECG showing no changes by report.   BNP 5900, Lactate 2.8.
Patient was started on peripheral dopa but was tachy to 130s and

switched changed to peripheral norepinephrine.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is comfortable and conversant.
He denies any pain and has no acute complaints.  His
norepinephrine was decreased from .1 to 0.6 mcg/kg/hr.

There was initial concern for upper GI bleed.  Pt reports dark
brown stools with drops of blood at home, and reports state 1x
500cc melanotic stool in the MICU.  GI was [**Month/Year (2) 4317**], and stool
was dark red, more consistent with lower GI/diverticular bleed.

EGD was not performed because of high risk cardiac status and
higher suspicion for lower GI bleed.  Baseline HCT 27-28, on
admission HCT 26, rec'd 1U PRBCs, now 29, stable since
admission.

Pt has a complex cardiac history and severe peripheral vascular
disease.  He has afib on warfarin. Had SFA stent placed last
week, started plavix.  Also started 10 day course of TMP/SMZ
post-procedure.  Also has [**Month/Year (2) 4318**], with EF 20%, mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation, and RV dysfunction, on [**2175-7-10**] TTE.
Cardiology [**Year (4 digits) 4317**], no acute intervention recommended.  Pt
will require lifetime anti-platelet therapy.  Per vascular
surgery, plavix 30 days followed by aspirin for life.  He has
CAD s/p CABG x 4 in [**2-/2166**], and VT s/p dual-chamber ICD
placement.  On admission troponin 0.61 --> 0.47 --> 0.56.

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2175-7-12**]):    No MRSA isolated.

Imaging:

EKG [**2175-7-9**]: Atrial demand pacing. Left axis deviation. Inferior
wall myocardial infarction, likely old. Poor R wave progression
of uncertain significance. Intraventricular conduction delay and
diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to
tracing #1 more atrial pacing is now seen. Increased R wave in
leads V3-V5 may reflect lead placement. Otherwise, no diagnostic
change.

EKG [**2175-7-9**]: Predominantly sinus rhythm versus ectopic atrial
rhythm with atrial premature contractions and one apparently
atrial paced beat. Left axis deviation. Prior inferior
myocardial infarction. Possible anterior wall myocardial
infarction of indeterminate age. Intraventricular conduction
defect. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2175-6-29**] atrial fibrillation has been
replaced by what appears to be predominantly sinus or ectopic
atrial rhythm. ST-T wave abnormalities are less marked in leads
V5 and V6. Clinical correlation and repeat tracing are
suggested.

CXR [**2175-7-9**]: Lungs are well expanded with improved aeration at
the left base.  Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is slightly
improved with no appreciable residual pulmonary edema.  No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pacemaker/defibrillator is in
unchanged position.

Echo [**2175-7-10**]: Biventricular cavity enlargement with regional and
global systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse
process. Pulmonary artery hypertension. At least moderate mitral
regurgitation. Severe tricuspid regurgitation. Mild-moderate
aortic regurgtiation. Dilated ascending aorta. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-9-17**], the right
ventricular cavity is more dilated with more prominent free wall
hypokinesis, the severity of TR is increased, and the estimated
PA systolic pressure is lower (likely due to progressive RV
dysfunction).

EKG [**2175-7-14**]: Sinus tachycardia. Incomplete left bundle-branch
block. Compared to the previous tracing atrial pacing is no
longer seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old male with h/o [**Month/Day/Year 4318**] (EF 20%), CAD s/p CABG,
peripheral vascular disease s/p SFA stent, diabetes, presented
with hypotension, now hemodynamically stable, no evidence of
active bleed.

Active Issues:
# Shock:  Yet unclear why he became hypotensive.  Cardiogenic
cause most likely given significant history (please see below).
GI bleed also likely explanation. Echo revealed decreased wall
motion compared to [**2-18**].  Sepsis is less likely as pt has been
afebrile and improved without antibiotics.  Pt required pressors
briefly, but weaned off and now stable with SBPs in
100-110s, on a slightly modified (decreased) home BP regimen
(see below).

# GI bleed:  Most likely a slow lower GI / diverticular bleed.
s/p 1U PRBCs ([**7-9**]) appropriate increase in HCT (26 to 28.8).  On
[**7-17**], HCT was 27.2, received another 1U PRBCs, HCT bumped to
28.5. Had evidence of moderate diverticuli ([**2-19**]) and moderate
gastritis/duodenal ulcer on EGD ([**2-19**]), downtrending HCT
starting in [**5-20**].  Several reports of BRBPR during
hospitalization and melanotic [**Doctor Last Name **] x 1 on [**2175-7-18**]. EGD not
indicated at this time given high cardiac risk and lower
clinical suspicion for upper GI bleed (however, as mentioned,
gastritis, duodenal ulcer on prior EGD). Received omeprazole
40mg [**Hospital1 **].  Will have follow-up with GI Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4321**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

# Anemia, acute on chronic:  Prior to admission baseline HCT
26-28; During hospitalization, received s/p 1U PRBCs in [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
increased appropriately and remained stable on the floor.  [**7-17**]
HCT was 27.2, pt received another 1U PRBCs, and HCT increased to
28.5.  Had several episodes of BRBPR during hospitalization.
Anemia is microcytic - MCV 75; likely iron-deficiency anemia in
the setting of recent slow GI bleed (per above, has
diverticulosis). [**Month (only) 412**] also have decreased production due to CKD.
Iron studies were normal.  We continued home iron
supplementation. F/U with GI for sources of GI bleeding.

# Supraventricular tachycardia - Pt had an episode of SVT on
[**7-14**], with HR in the 140s.  EKG consistent with atrial
tachycardia, no ischemic changes.  Resolved with carotid
massage, IV metoprolol, additional po metoprolol, and gentle
IVF.  Given concern for GI bleed, checked HCT, which was 30.4.
Home metoprolol 25mg XL was increased to metoprolol 50mg XL.

****HIGH IMPORTANCE****
# Peripheral vascular disease s/p stent with right LE ulcer.
Warfarin and Clopidogrel were briefly held given fear of GI
bleed.  Restarted Warfarin and Clopidogrel.  ******Patient will
need lifetime antiplatelet rx:  per vascular & GI recs, will
continue with warfarin & plavix until [**2175-7-28**], then go back to
warfarin & aspirin*****  Wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4317**], and
gave recommendations for management of foot ulcers.  Pt
completed post-procedural antibiotics prophylaxis with
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole on [**7-13**].

# Altered MS: Delirium vs. baseline dementia.  Pt received
haldol once in the [**Month/Day (1) **] for episode of agitation.  Touched base
with family to reassess baseline mental status, and he seems to
have baseline confusion.  Would try to avoid haldol in the
future for moderately elevated QTc = 480.

# [**Month/Day (1) 4318**] (EF 20%): worsened from [**2-/2174**] echo, cardiology
evaluated, may have had a new coronary event undetected in
nursing home, no acute intervention warranted.  Continued a
change in dose of metoprolol (slightly increased), torsemide,
lisinopril (lower dose).  Will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4322**] in
cardiology.

# CAD s/p CABG with Troponinemia: EKGs unremarkable, echo
revealed worsening wall motion abnormality, but no acute
coronary event; continue medical management

# [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD
Cr peaked to 1.7, and returned to baseline 1.3-1.5:  [**Month (only) 412**] have
been an element of
hypoxic injury following shock episode, also a component of
drug-related injury on TMP/SMZ (now complete)

[**Hospital 4323**] MEDICAL CONDITIONS:
# Atrial fibrillation:  CHADS2 = 4 = 8.5% chance of stroke per
year.  Continue anticoagulation as above.  INR = 1.8 on d/c.

# Hypertension:  Not an active issue, currently controlled on
home regimen

# Diabetes:
Held metformin (on SSI in hospital). Will restart on DC.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

# Pt must have LIFETIME antiplatelet therapy because he has
right lower extremity stent.

*******Continue warfarin AND clopidogrel until
[**2175-7-28**]*******STOP clopidogrel on [**2175-7-28**] and continue warfarin
and aspirin thereafter for life*********

# Gastroenterology follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
# Cardiology follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4322**]

# Consider starting spironolactone given mortality benefit for
severe [**Last Name (STitle) 4318**] if BP is rising

# Please make appointment with patient's PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 1 week after

# Please follow up creatinine / renal function in approximately
1 week, with PCP

#Lisinopril lowered to 2.5mg po qd in setting of borderline

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],
It was a pleasure being involved in your care during your recent
hospitalization.  You were admitted because your blood pressure
dropped significantly, and you required medications to help your
blood pressure.

We were concerned that you were bleeding from your
gastrointestinal tract because there was blood in your stool,
and your blood counts were low.  You received two blood
transfusions and your blood counts went back up. You will need
to follow up with your gastroenterologist for further evaluation
of causes of bleeding.

On [**2175-6-28**], you had a stent placed to open up the vessels in
your right leg.  Because of this, you will need to take blood
thinners for the rest of your life, to prevent the stent from
clotting up and cutting off the circulation from your leg.

Your heart does not pump as well as a healthy heart.  Please
weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 233**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
# Metoprolol XL 25mg daily was changes to Metoprolol 12.5mg po
tid because of your fast heart rate
# Pravastatin was replaced with atorvastatin 80 mg to more
effectively treat your high cholesterol and protect your heart
# Your lisinopril dose was lowered from 5mg to 2.5mg because
your blood pressure was low. Please ask about increasing the
dose back to 5mg once your blood pressure improves.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#Patient requires LIFETIME anti-platelet therapy because of
right lower extremity stent, placed [**2175-6-28**], PCP informed
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] Warfarin + Plavix 30 days [**Date range (1) 4324**]/[**2175**]
- Warfarin + Aspirin, [**7-28**]- forever
# Cardiology:  Worsening cardiac function; episode of atrial
tachycardia; consider starting spironolactone
# Gastroenterology:  Evaluation for cause of lower
gastrointestinal bleed sufficient to cause anemia

Pertinent Results:
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**2162-5-5**]
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and doppler ultrasound examination of the
left forearm demonstrates a patent cephalic vein and patent A-V
fistula graft of the left brachial artery and left cephalic
vein. The proximal cephalic vein at the graft site measures
approximately 2 cm in diameter. No fluid collections, abscess,
or fistulous tract is identified.
IMPRESSION: No fluid collections or fistulous tract identified.

MRI T-/L-spine ([**5-9**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Evaluation of thoraic and lumbar spine demonstrates no
definite evidence of abscess.
2. Evaluation of cervical spine is limited secondary to
patient's motion. There is a suggestion of degenerative disc
disease at the level of the C3-4, C5-6 and C6-7. However,
evaluation is limited secondary to patient motion.

MRI PELVIS W/O & W/CONTRAST; MR RECONSTRUCTION IMAGING ([**5-10**])
IMPRESSION: Large subcutaneous collection with extension into
the right lateral abdominal wall musculature. This complex fluid
collection is non- specific and may represent an abscess,
hematoma or seroma.

RENAL TRANSPLANT U.S. RIGHT  [**2162-5-10**]
IMPRESSION: Again seen is a right lower quadrant transplant
kidney showing evidence of little or no diastolic flow
peripherally and resistive indices near 1.0. There is a large
collection just lateral to the transplant kidney which was
previously described as a lymphocele but now shows evidence of a
hematocrit effect within. Findings are consistent with
hemorrhage within a lymphocele, and less likely an infected
lymphocele. The native kidney shows evidence of polycystic
kidney disease.

WHITE BLOOD CELL STUDY  [**2162-5-11**]
IMPRESSION: 1) Mild, diffusely increased uptake in the right
lung, which may
represent a pulmonary inflammatory process. Can not rule out
pneumonia. 2)
Large focus of abnormal uptake in the right abdominal/pelvic
wall, which could
represent an abscess. 3) Diffusely increased uptake in the right
hemi-pelvis,
which appears to be anterior to the right ileum, which could be
another site of
abscess.

US HEMATOMA SUBCUT DRAIN INCIS; CT GUIDED NEEDLE PLACTMENT
([**2162-5-14**])
IMPRESSION: Successful aspirate of right lower pannus fluid
collection, draining approximately 300 cc of dark bloody fluid.
The specimens were sent to microbiology.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-5-16**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Patchy foci of peripheral ground glass opacification within
the right upper lobe. Although some of the ground glass
opacities were present previously, those located medially within
the anterior segment appear new. In the setting of
immunosuppression and positive findings on a nuclear medicine
white blood cell scan in the right lung, these findings are
concerning for infection.
2. Band-like area of opacity within the lingula appears improved
and is attributed to residual focal atelectasis versus scar. The
previously noted left lower lobe process has resolved, and a
left pleural effusion has significantly decreased in size.
3. Persistent small pericardial effusion and resolution of small
right
pleural effusion.
4. New 2 cm diameter low-density lesion within the spleen, of
uncertain etiology. Splenic infarct or abscess should be
considered in the appropriate clinical setting, but this is
difficult to assess on this unenhanced study. Consider a
dedicated left upper quadrant ultrasound or complete abdominal
CT for more completer characterization.

GUIDANCE FOR ABSCESS; PERITONEAL ABSCESS DRAINAGE US; GUIDANCE
FOR ABSCESS [**2162-5-17**]
Preliminary ultrasonographic images of the superficial tissues
of the right lower quadrant demonstrate a large cavity measuring
10.5 x 9.6 x 7.8 cm. The superior aspects contain essentially
clear fluid with greater amounts of free flowing debris seen
throughout the lower dependent portions of the cavity. The
collection is superficial to the abdominal musculature and the
renal transplant.  Status post successful superficial abscess
drainage with 8 French [**Last Name (un) 4909**] catheter. 5cc specimen was sent
for culture and sensitivity.

MR RECONSTRUCTION IMAGING  [**2162-5-18**]
1) Numerous bilateral renal cysts, compatible with history of
polycystic kidney disease. No enhancing solid lesions are seen
in the kidneys to suggest foci of infection or malignancy.
2) Interval decreased size of right lower quadrant abdominal
wall collection.

MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-5-24**]
1. Areas of restricted diffusion within the left temporal and
left parietal lobe, not enhancing. Appearance of these lesions
is most consistent with embolic etiology (and/or septic emboli).
Focal cerebritis is considered less likely.
2. Absent flow in the short segment of the left middle cerebral
artery is most suggestive of acute embolic disease in
conjunction with the temporal and parietal lobe findings.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**2162-5-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Small simple cysts within the liver which is otherwise
unremarkable.
2) No evidence of abscess in the right lower quadrant.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-6-2**]
IMPRESSION: Since the previous examinations, the left temporal
lobe infarction extended to involve greater territory than was
previously apparent. No new areas of infarction are observed.
There is no evidence of recent hemorrhage.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-6-10**]
1 High-attenuation ascites worrisome for hemorrhage surrounding
the liver. No perirenal fluid collection surrounding the
transplant kidney is seen.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-6-17**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Decrease in size of subcapsular hepatic hematoma.
2) Unchanged appearance of multiple low-density hepatic foci.
3) Stable appearance of splenic infarction.
4) Stable appearance of left pelvic/inguinal soft-tissue density
mass.
5) Diffuse ground glass opacities at the lung bases which are
worse than on the prior examination. Appearances are most
consistent with congestive heart failure or volume overload.
However, in a patient who is being immunosuppressed,
consideration should also be made for diffuse pulmonary
infection.

TEE [**2162-7-8**]
Conclusions:
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There right ventricular function
appears
depressed. The aortic leaflet is tricuspid. There is thickening
of the base of
the ?NCC of the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. No obvious
aortic root abscesses are seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately
thickened. There are moderate-sized mobile echodensitiy on the
bases of the
anterior and posterior mitral leaflets (posterior >anterior)
consistent with
vegetations. There are no leaflets perforations seen. There is
moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation. Given the extent of
vegetations, a mitral
annular abscess cannot be fully excluded. The pulmonary artery
systolic
pressure was not measured. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared to the prior TEE study of [**2162-5-26**] (tape reveiwed), the
mitral valve
remains thickend with mobile echodensities at the bases of the
anterior and
posterior mitral valve leaflets consistent with vegetations. The
large highly
mobile prolapsing segment seen on the piror study is no longer
present. There
is thickening of the base of the ?NCC of the aortic valve which
was present of
the prior study. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure was not
measured on
the current study.

HEAD CT [**2162-7-12**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intra or extraaxial
hemorrhage. There is no hydrocephalus, mass effect, or shift of
normally midline structures, and the ventricles, cisterns and
sulci are unremarkable. The area of hypodensity extending to the
cortex in the left temporoparietal area is unchanged. The
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter distinction is preserved elsewhere, and there
is no evidence of new territorial infarction. The residual gyral
enhancement associated with contrast administration, which was
seen on the most recent study, has resolved. There is no
definite evidence of infarction elsewhere. The visualized
osseous structures, paranasal sinuses, and soft tissues are
unrmarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of the previously seen large left
temporoparietal infarct
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial
infarction.
3. No other significant interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course after [**5-19**]

1)ID: As noted earlier, pt was started on vancomycin, rifampin
and gentamycin for persistent MRSA bacteremia, endocarditis, and
meningitis.  On [**5-16**] CXR and CT lung showed RUL ground glass
opacity, and WBC scan showed increased uptake at the RUL.  Pt
initially started on levofloxaxin but switched to Ceftaz for
hospital acquired pneumonia which was eventually d/c'd on [**5-23**]
because sputum culture was negative for gram negative rods but
did grow MRSA.  As noted earlier, pt was found to have a fluid
collection around RLQ abdominal wall (pannicular seroma) which
was drained by pigtail, and was followed by incision and
drainage in the OR.  The tissue was sent to pathology which only
showed fibrous exudate with reactive changes.  The MRI report of
native polycystic kidneys showed no signs of infection or
malignancy.  Pt has a left upper extremity AV fistula which did
not have any evidence of infectious tract by ultrasound.  Pt was
on Gentamycin inititally but was discontinued due to possible
renal toxicity with increasing creatinine.  Pt was initially on
rifampin for the synergy effect with vancomycin, but MRSA from
[**5-22**] Cx was Rifampin resistant so Rifampin was discontinued.
CMV viral load was negative and HSV negative in CSF.  Pt was
started on linezolid on [**5-26**] in addition to Vanco since there
was a corncern that she might be developing VISA.  [**Hospital3 4910**]
was checking the MBC and MIC. However, Linezolid was thought to
have possible antagonistic acitvity to Vanco, therefore it was
discontinued after 2 days, and she was switched to Daptomycin
500mg IV q 48 and was eventually changed to 500 mg q24.  Since
then, patient has been on daptomycin 500 mg qd and vancomycin by
level which was switched to Vanc 1gm q48 on [**7-12**] after
improvement in CrCl.  She will be on daptomycin and vancomycin
indefinitely until and after the valve replacement surgery.
Patient needs to have vancomycin trough level checked to keep it
above 15.  Pt also completed 7 day course of acyclovir for HSV1
on her lips.  Pt also developed pseudomonas pneumonia while she
was in the MICU with positive sputum culture from [**6-3**] to [**6-18**]
which was treated with a course of piperacillin.  Pt also had a
yeast UTI which was treated with fluconazole, and another UTI
with pseudomonas and E.Coli.  Piperacillin was initially started
on [**7-9**] for pseudomonas, but later E.Coli sensitivity came back
resistant to piperacillin, so it was switched to Zosyn which is
sensitive against both bacteria.  Patient will need to complete
a total of 14 day course of Zosyn (last day [**2162-7-25**]) for her
psuedomonas/E.Coli UTI.  Last positive blood culture for MRSA
was from [**2162-5-22**], and last positive sputum culture was from
[**2162-6-16**].  Patient will be on Vancomycin and daptomycin
indefinitely until mitral valve replacement.

2)Renal: Pt initially presented with ARF (Cr 2.6) on CRI
(1.5-2.0 baseline) thought to be from pre-renal azotemia
secondary to sepsis.  Patient was initially on tacroliumus and
prednisone for post-transplant immunosuppression, but they were
held on [**5-25**] for persistent bacteremia and endocarditis that
could not be cleared with multiple antibiotics.  It was thought
that clearing her infection was more important at that time than
reducing the risk of rejection.  Creatinine continued to be
elevated (high of 5.1) and it was thought that ARF could also be
from Gentamycin ATN or acyclovir crystal nephropathy.
Gentamycin was eventually discontinued.  Pt completed a 7 day
course of acyclovir for her oral HSV on [**5-18**]. Her baseline
creatinine level after the renal transplant is between 1.5 -
2.0, on admission Cr level 2.6, and her Cr level returned to her
baseline at 1.5 by [**2162-5-22**] after she started producing urine and
was able to hydrate her with IVF.  However, pt became volume
overloaded after [**Month/Day/Year **] and went into pulmonary edema
secondary to severe mitral regurgitation.  After that, pt was
receiving lasix for aggressive diuresis which raised her
cratinine to 2.3-2.4.  Pt was then gently and slowly hydrated
with D5W to correct hypernatremia (Na 150).  After several days
of net positive volume status with gentle IVF [**Month/Day/Year **], her
creatinine was lowered to 1.6  During the latter part of her
hosptial stay, the main issue was the fluid balance with the
goal of euvolemia.  Pt was very prone for pulmonary edema from
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but diuresis caused her renal function to go
down.  Pt went into MICU on [**6-25**] for fluid overload after tube
feed via NGT was initiated and patient recovered after
aggressive diuresis.  Currently, pt is euvolemic or slightly dry
but the balance between pulmonary function and renal function is
at an optimal level.  PEG was placed on [**7-2**] and tube feed was
initiated.  Pt was later toloerating some po liquids.   Since
the blood culture has been negative since [**5-22**], pt afebrile, and
the reatinine level came down to 1.7 but increased slightly to
1.8, tacrolimus was re-started on [**7-10**].  Current dose is
tacrolimus  4 mg [**Hospital1 **] with goal of level [**2-5**].  Pt needs to get a
lab (CBC, BMP, tacrolimus level, vanc level) in 1 week from the
discharge.  Pt needs to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks
from the discharge for her post-transplant renal management.

3)Neuro: Pt was initially admitted for fever and altered mental
status, eventually diagnosed with MRSA meningitis which was
treated and resolved. MRI of spine was negative for spinal
infectious processes.   Pt then developed left temporal lobe CVA
from septic emboli on [**5-21**].  Initially pt was found to be in
confusional state and neurology was consulted.  On exam, she was
alert, disoriented to place and time, fluent langauge but she
was having word finding difficuly.  She was able to perform
elemental repetition but unable to do more complex tasks.
Cranial nerve exam notable for right ptosis but no Horner's
Syndrome.  LP was recommended but her husband refused to
consent.  MRI of the head showed multiple likely septic emboli
and left temporal hyperintensity.  Pt was started on IV
acyclovir because of the left temporal lobe enhancement
concerning for HSV meningitis.  After 3 days of IV acyclovir,
patient's renal function worsened with hypotensions.  EEG showed
no evidence of seizures.  Repeat head CT showed evolving
infarct, changes consistent with encephalomalacia.  MRI [**6-10**]
demonstrated no additional CVAs.  Her language improved over
time, and she is able to comprehend, answer questions and follow
commands, however still mumbling and difficult to uderstand.
She was confused and agitated at first requiring sitters,
restraints and standing Haldol, but it improved over time
requiring no sitter but still getting standing haldol 1mg tid.
On [**7-6**] pt developed left wrist/hand pain and weakness that was
new.  The weakness and pain were isolated to the wrist and
worsened by flexion and extension.  The exam was inconsistent
with CVA since her other left arm muscles were not affected, and
pt was in severe pain.  The X-ray of the wrist showed no
evidence of fracture or dislocation.  Etilogy was thought as
another septic embolic stroke, sprain or tenosynovitis after
prolonged restraints around her wrists for agitation.  Neurology
was consulted, MRI of the head ordered but was limited by motion
artifacts, and subsequent head CT showed only old stroke at the
left temporal/parietal and no new changes.  It was thought that
she had a small septic emboli to one of the distal left arm
arteries causing pain and possibly caused a damage to the
posterior interosseous nerve, which would explain the wrist
drop, weak grasp muscles, and pain.  The left wrist was on
splint which seemed to minimize the pain.  Overall, her mental
status improved after the septic emboli event.  Pt can state her
name, recognizes her husband, and follow simple commands.  She
is able to get out to chair and able to make simple words.
However, she still appears confused and disoriented at times,
and making inappropriate response.  Patient still has residual
Wernicke's type aphasia where she can make fluent speech but her
comprehension is not completely intact.  She should see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
(neurology) in outpatient once discharged to a rehab for
evaluation of her stroke and also for possible EMG and nerve
conduction studies for her wrist drop.

5)[**Last Name (STitle) 4911**] valve endocarditis: Patient with known vegetation on
mitral valve and subsequent severe mitral regurgitation.
Initial plan was to have the mitral valve replaced by CT surgeon
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], but was unfortunately postponed due to her
multiple medical complications including persistent bacteremia,
MRSA meningitis, septic embolism to the brain and spleen,
subcapsular liver hematoma, CHF and pulmonary edema.  CT surgery
did not want to operate on her until until blood culture for at
least 14 days.  TEE on [**5-13**] showed increased size in vegetation.
 TEE from [**5-25**] again showed large vegetation on the mitral valve
involving the anterior and posterior leaflets with a large
mobile element.  No mitral valve abscess was seen but could not
be excluded.  Again showing 3+MR.  Compared with the findings of
the prior study of [**2162-5-14**], the mitral vegetation appears larger
and has a greater mobile element. The severity of mitral
regurgitation appeared similar. The LA appears more dilated. The
RV systolic function appears worse. The LV systolic function
remains hyperdynamic.  Repeat Echo done on [**2162-6-9**] showed the
mitral valve vegetation that is somewhat larger (previously more
spherical) and more mobile.  The mitral annular echodensity is
more prominent c/w possible healing/fibrosing abscess.  Right
ventricular hypokinesis was more prominent at that time.  Pt
underwent cardiac cath on [**6-9**] because of anticipated MVR, but
cath complicated by embolized swann cath, likely now in coronary
venous system. Post-procedure additional complication of groin
bleed with fluid collection around the liver and hct drop from
28 to 20. Pt has been transfused to hct 33.  This complication
further postponed the mitral valve replacement surgery.  Repeat
abdominal CT on [**6-17**] showed decreased size in the subcapsular
hepatic hematoma, and pt's Hct has been stable since.  Pt got
another TEE on [**7-9**] which showed absence of the large mobile
vegetation.  Pt will be followed up by CT surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4912**] in the future for possible mitral valve replacement.

6)CHF:  Multiple TTE and TEE showed EF function ranging from
60-80% in four cardiac echo studies.  However pt had elevated TR
gradient, and severe ([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation in addition to
the growing mitral valve vegetation.  Pt had elevated right
heart pressure secondary to worsening valvular disease.  Pt
responded well to afterload reduction with hydralazine and
nitrate, avoiding ACE-inhibitor because of its effect on renal
function.  BP was initially controlled with those meds, but
after diuresis with lasix and metolazone pt no longer required
them to control BP.  Pt was repeated getting fluid overloaded
and having respiratory distress requiring multiple trips to
MICU. From [**Date range (1) 4913**] she was in the MICU where she was intubated
for airway protection after the CVA.  Pt was extubated on [**6-14**],
post-pyloric placed and tube feed was started, and has been
stable on the floor since with improvement in the renal
function.  However, On [**6-24**] pt became tachypnic using accessory
muscles due to fluid overload and was sent back to the MICU for
BIPAP trial. Her respiratory status improved after aggressive
diurses but her creatine level went up as well.  Patient was
initially diuresised with IV lasix and metolazone but was
discontinued with the plan to keep her euvolemic and correction
of lytes and free water gently.  Pt's lung remained clear since
but she continues to appear dry with slow rehydration since
concerning for pulmonary edema.  PEG placed on [**7-2**] with tube
feed with free water started.  Pt was having moderate amount of
residuals but able to tolerate tube feeds.  Bedside speech and
swallow evaluated the patient on [**7-5**] with marked improvement,
although she was still aspirating occasionally.  Video
swallowing done on [**7-6**] and pt now able to tolerate thickened
pureed. Her volume status remained sensitive throughout the
hospital stay, and easily tipped over to either fluid
overload/pulmonary edema or hypovolemia with worsening renal
function.  Underlying problem is her severe mitral
regurgitation.  Until she gets a mitral valve replacement, this
issue would not be solved.

7)Arrythmia:  Pt developed CVA from septic emboli on [**5-21**]. Pt
went to fluro-guided LP on [**5-24**] and one hour after the LP was
done, pt became tachypnic and bradycardic in the 60's (normally
in the 100's) with EKG showing possible junctional rhythm.  The
conduction defect was thought to be from the extemsion of the
mitral valve vegetation.  After transferring to the MICU and
being intubated and sedated, pt was having episodes of
bradycardia (40's) and tachycardia (120's) with several runs of
V-tach and ectopy including bigeminy.  Arrythmia initially
concerning for myocardial abscess due to large extension of the
vegetation, but TEE showed no evidence of abscess.  Pt remained
on tele once back to the floor with no significant events.  QT
interval were monitored because she was on standing heldol for
agitation.

8)Anemia: Pt has a history of chronic anemia from chronic
illness or from her renal disease.  Pt's Hct continued to drop
intermittenly with unclear reason and she was transfused several
times to keep her Hct near 30.  There was a big Hct drop when
subcapsular hematoma of the liver developed on [**6-10**] after the
cardiac cath.  During remaininder of the course, Hct was stable
at near 30.  Pt has been getting Epogen once a week (on Fri) and
will be discharged with that regimen.  Fe studies were
consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

9)Diabetes: Pt originally on lantus 11u + insulin ss which was
changed to NPH 13u am and 7u pm.  However she did not require
insulin since when tubefeed was at minimal setting.  The finger
stick level were within the normal range 100-160 without use of
insulin at first.  As pt tolerated more tube feed and po, am and
pm NPH were restarted.

10)Nutrition:  Pt was initially on the tube feed for nutrition
after the CVA event and intubation at MICU, but was having
gastric fullness.  Post-pyloric/dobhoff was inserted on [**2162-6-23**]
and tube feed resumed, but pt puled out the dobhoof on the same
day due after a tachypnic episode.  PEG was placed on [**2162-7-2**]
and ultracal started.  Pt initially having high residuals on
tube feed but improved with Reglan 5mg qid.  On [**7-5**], bedside
speech/swallow evaluation showed marked improvement compared to
previously although pt still aspirating clears.  Pt underwent
video swallow on [**7-6**] where she was able to tolerate nectar thick
pureed liquid, but pt still had some difficulty with solids and

Service:  NEUROLOGIC MEDICINE

ADDENDUM:  The following history and physical is as noted on
arrival by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old woman
with atrial fibrillation on Warfarin who was found down at
her home on the day of presentation.  On arrival, she was
unresponsive and no family was available at the bedside and,
therefore, the history is limited but we know that she has
left eye deviation and a left-sided weakness initially.  Per
the EMS and ED records, she is thought to have been sitting
in a chair at home and was noted to be less responsive at
about 8:30 p.m. on the night of arrival.  About an hour
later, EMS was called and they found her to be minimally
responsive with withdrawal on the right side to pain and no
response on the left.  Her eyes were deviated to the left.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Ischemic stroke 20 years ago with transient left-sided
weakness.
3.  Cataract surgery.
4.  Hypertension.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Warfarin.
2.  Losartan.
3.  HCTZ.
4.  Potassium chloride.
5.  Magnesium supplements.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She does not
drink or smoke.  She lives in [**Location 620**] with her husband,
[**Name (NI) **].  Their number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 15904**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Blood
pressure 220/100, pulse 80, respirations 18, 75-90% 02
saturation on arrival.  General:  The initial examination was
made after sedation with Fentanyl, Ativan, and paralytics;
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw her briefly prior to intubation.  She was
unresponsive to verbal stimuli and would not follow commands.
Corneals were present bilaterally.  She would withdrawal to
pain in all four extremities and was moving all extremities
spontaneously.  Her eyes were deviated to the left.  The toes
were upgoing on the left and equivocal on the right.  The
deep tendon reflexes were diminished but symmetric.
Subsequently, she was intubated by the ED staff for airway
protection.

Further examination revealed an intubated elderly woman with
a supple neck.  Lungs:  Clear.  Heart:  Regular.  Neurologic:
Her pupils were pinpoint and nonreactive.  She had no dolls.
The face seemed symmetric bilaterally.  Bulk was normal but
tone was decreased throughout.  However, she was paralyzed.
Muscle strength could not be tested.  Reflexes were
diminished throughout.  Toes were upgoing on the left and
equivocal on the right.  Gait and coordination could not be
assessed.

STUDIES:  INR 2.3, PT 18.6, PTT 30.2.  White count 13.2,
hematocrit 38.1, platelets 224,000.  The U/A showed small
blood and protein of 100.  ABGs 7.58, 22, 417, and 21.
Sodium 128, K 4.4, chloride 98, bicarbonate 23, BUN 33,
creatinine 1.7, glucose 144, CK 158.

Head CT did not reveal an acute bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 15905**] was admitted to the Neuro
Intensive Care Unit for further management.  Her clinical
presentation is most consistent with a significant cerebral
infarction.  Her further workup revealed a significant
myocardial infarction with a troponin greater than 50 and CK
MB greater than 20.  Her neurologic status continued to be
poor.  Her imaging studies done revealed multivessel ischemic
infarction including MCA and PCA territories bilaterally in
the setting of an acute MI in a patient with atrial
fibrillation.

Her clinical prognosis is extremely poor and neurologically
she appears to be devastated after multivessel infarction,
although we continued to control her blood pressure and
provide Warfarin.

Given the overall clinical picture, a family discussion
resulted in a decision to focus on Mrs.[**Known lastname 15906**] comfort.
Her medications were discontinued and she was given
analgesics as needed for her comfort.  Subsequently, she died
on [**2137-2-22**] in no pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His lungs were clear.  His heart was
regular rate.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Bowel sounds were present.  He had a II/VI systolic ejection
murmur, no S3 or S4.  His extremities were warm and well
perfused with no edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the hospital for a
cardiac catheterization and found to have multivessel disease
and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted at that time.

The patient was scheduled for carotid duplex prior to his
coronary artery bypass graft which was found to be normal.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2118-10-14**],
where a coronary artery bypass graft times five was
performed, left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to OM1 and 2, saphenous vein
graft to ramus and radial artery to the right coronary
artery.  The patient was transferred postoperatively to the
CSRU where he did well, slightly hypertensive overnight, but
is able to be weaned from his ventilator and extubated.  He
was given Lopressor intravenous for his high blood pressure
and he responded.  He was given Toradol for pain.
Postoperative day number one, his Morphine was switched to
Percocet, and the patient was started on Isosorbide and his
diet was advanced.  He continued to improve.   The patient
was transferred to the floor on [**2118-10-15**], where he did well.
His chest tube was removed.  He was out of bed and physical
therapy was consulted for ambulation.  Beta blockers and
Lasix were started at that time.  Physical therapy felt that
he would require multiple treatments to achieve his goal and
possible discharge to rehabilitation or to home with physical
therapy services.  He continued to improve, and on
postoperative day number three, his incision was found to
have slight drainage.  That area was drained and new
Steri-Strips were applied with Betadine cleaning. Also his
Lopressor was continued 25 mg p.o. twice a day.  His pacing
wires were removed and the patient was on aggressive
pulmonary toilet.  The patient was watched.  Postoperatively,
he improved on physical therapy and was able to achieve
stairs and stage V, and it was planned that the patient would
be discharged home with VNA services the following day.  The
patient was discharged in stable condition.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1726**] is a 50M with a PMH of polysubstance abuse, Hepatitis
C, and depression who was found down by his family with altered
mental status on the evening of [**7-29**].  Per the patient's family,
he had been on a week-long binge with multile substances, those
of which are known to the family include: ETOH, benzodiazapines,
heroin, trazodone, and crack.  He was discovered asleep in his
car outside of his family's house on the evening of [**7-29**].  The
next morning, he was not fully arousable.  He was taken to [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital on the morning of [**7-30**] for altered mental status.
The work-up at [**Hospital3 **] included:
1. Liver failure
2. Acute renal failure
3. Elevated cardiac enzymes
4. Left arm skin breakdown with compartment syndrome.
5. MRI of the head showing multiple embolic CVA's
6. Rhabdomyolysis
He was transferrd to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
In our ED, he presented with the following vital signs: 190/95,
104, 97%RA.  Clinically he was somnolent, following simple
commands, hypertensive, and tachycardic.  He was given valium
for presumed alcohol withdrawl, and was then intubated for
airway protection.  Serum/urine tox confirmed the presence of
benzodiazapines and cocaine.  He was found to be in fulminant
liver failure with a transaminitis and coagulopathy.  It was
unclear if this was due to tylenol toxicity vs. shock picture,
so the ED administered N-acetyl cysteine with the toxicology
service consulting, despite negative tylenol on his tox screen.
He received a 150mg/kg bolus over 60 minutes  Neurology was
consulted for the acute mental status changes with embolic
strokes- they had no further recommendations, as anticoagulating
him would not be possible given his coagulopathy.  Orthopedics
was consulted for his left arm compartment syndrome, and plan
for a faciotomy.  His rhabdomyolysis was managed with saline
diuresis, with approximately 6-7L of NS.  He was also found to
be in acute renal failure, with a Cr of 3.7.  His CK-MB and
troponin were elevated, cardiology was notified of the admision,
but had no current recommendations.  Labs were otherwise notable
for a positive UA, a normal lactate level, hyponatremia,
hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia.  Our ED ordered a CT torso and
cervical spine.

--------------------


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1726**] is a 50 year-old male with a history of
polysubstance abuse who presented [**2175-7-31**] with altered mental
status after being found down by family members. Extended
hospital course was as follows, by problem:

#. Rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure: Patient presented
with CK ~40,000 in the setting of ARF, compartment syndrome, and
hypocalcemia. This was likely secondary to immobilization after
polysubstance intoxication. Patient was hydrated and received
approximately 24 liters. The decision was made to start HD and
his CK slowly began trending down; initially, temporary HD
catheter was placed in femoral artery. Later IR placed a
tunneled catheter in the right subclavian artery which had to be
replaced after patient pulled it out. Over his hospitalization
his Cr and urine output improved. Patient received last
hemodialysis treatment on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**8-18**]. On [**8-22**],
hemodialysis catheter was removed by interventional radiology.
Cr at discharge was 1.1.

#. Altered mental status: Patient was obtunded and comatose at
presentation - intubated for airway protection. MRI showed
multiple embolic strokes, and toxicology showed alcohol, heroin,
and crack/cocaine. Differential included multiple CVAs,
substance abuse, hepatic encephalopathy (stage II-III),
infection, and delirium. On the medicine floor, patient was
oriented only to himself initially and required a sitter. Haldol
used PRN for agitation and confusion. Poor mental status had a
component secondary to the strokes with superimposed delirium.
On discharge, mental status was improved, but patient still
having confusion and memory problems. [**Name (NI) **] clear source was found
for the strokes. Patient had a repeat echocardiogram which was
negative for a PFO. Possibly due to arrythmia and/or transient
wall motion abnormality during drug intoxication that produced
thrombi in the heart, which then embolized to brain.
     At [**Hospital1 18**], neurology involved and decision was made not to
anticoagulate given severe coagulopathy on admission. Carotid
ultrasound was done and 40% stenosis bilaterally. Blood cultures
grew staph aureus in [**12-30**] bottles from arterial line and he was
placed on vancomycin dosed by HD with a plan for 14 day course.
Subsequent blood cultures were negative, and vancomycin was
discontinued. Echocardiogram was without vegetation. Following
closure of left upper extremity fasciotomy and resolution of
acute liver failure, patient was placed on aspirin and Statin.
On floor begin rehab with PT, OT. Will need these services at
rehab.

#. Fulminant liver failure: Unclear etiology. At level of
transaminitis at presentation, the differential was narrowed to
toxin-induced, shock state, and viral hepatitis. [**Month (only) 116**] have been
transaminitis secondary to rhabdomyolysis. The patient has known
hepatitis C, viral load 6.3 million. Serum was negative for
acetaminophen, although he was started on NAC in the ED. Doppler
study of the portal and hepatic veins was done and showed patent
vessels. Albumin on presentation was 2.8. AST and ALT peaked at
3739 and 9036. Trended to normal over his admission. Consider
Ribavirin and interferon after resolution of acute illness and
depression.

#. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Unclear if the
patient suffered a crush injury versus bleed into the arm from
coagulopathy. On presentation, patient was taken for emergent
fasciotomy in the operating room. A wound vac was placed, and
plastics involved for grafting area. Wound vac was removed on
[**8-22**]. Patient had limited movement of left digits. Physical
therapy and occupational therapy were also involved. Per
plastics recommendations, patient is to follow up with plastics
clinic during the week of discharge. Post op a 4cm area of
necrosis in the center of his graft developed, was stable, did
not appear infected. Plastics thought it was a region of failed
graft tissue recommended close observation. OT recommended
placing splint (over padding) on left hand to prevent
contracture.

#. Alcohol withdrawal - Placed on CIWA protocol with lorazepam
prn >10 given hepatic failure. Did not have withdraw sx. After
several days, patient was discharged off of CIWA protocol.
Social work became involved for substance abuse counseling.

#. NSTEMI: On admission, cardiac biomarkers were elevated.
Likely demand during multi-organ system failure. EKG did not
show ischemic changes. Cardiology was involved; given
coagulopathy, fasciotomy, and liver failure, aspirin and Statin
were not started initially. Beta-blocker was added. Later,
patient was started on low-dose aspirin and Statin.

#. Diarrhea: In ICU and on medicine floor, patient continued to
have loose stools. C. diff toxin was sent and was found to be
negative. Stool cultures were also sent and showed no organisms.
Diarrhea resolved.

#. Fever - On [**2175-8-2**], the patient had a witnessed aspiration
event. CXR showed possible aspiration pneumonia; this cleared on
subsequent x-rays. On [**2175-8-3**], had fevers to 101.7 and developed
a leukocytosis to 14.7 with left shift. Right femoral line
d/c'ed. Due to possible aspiration PNA, started on Unasyn and
kept on Vancomycin. As he continued spiking fevers, the concern
for HAP/VAP was raised. Unasyn changed to Zosyn and
levofloxacin, continued on Vancomycin on [**8-5**]. Sputum cultures
were obtained showing pan-sensitive serratia. Urine Culture on
[**8-5**] grew pseudomonas only sensitive to amikacin. Vanc and Zosyn
were discontinued on [**8-7**] as there was no MRSA and as serratia
was pansensitive. On [**8-7**], amikacin was started. ID consultant
thought that Pseudomonas in urine was not clinically significant
(as urine had cleared) and that Serratia in sputum was not
likely pathologic in this patient's case; antibiotics were
discontinued [**8-8**].

#. Right leg bone infarct - Patient was found to have pain in
right knee. Plain film was done and showed right bone infarct.
Orthopedics was consulted and felt that no further
imaging/intervention was necessary. Patient may required knee
replacement in future. Source for infarct was believed to be
from embolic strokes.

#. Depression - Reports a history of depression, formerly on
Paxil and trazodone. During long hospitalization expressed
worsening of depression symptoms. On [**8-31**] Paxil and trazodone
were restarted. These doses may need to be adjusted. Social work
consult to discuss current situation.

#. Anemia - Likely multifactorial, including bone marrow
suppression from substance abuse, bleeding from LUE. B12, folate
studies normal. Iron studies not consistent with iron-deficiency
anemia or anemia of chronic disease. Threshold for transfusion
hematocrit <= 21. Did not require transfusion. Will need to be
monitored.

#. FEN - Diet changed [**2175-8-18**] to thin liquids and soft foods.
Ensure twice daily.

#. Skin wounds- several skin wounds, graft site on left forearm.
Also, pressure ulcers on lower extremities. Will need daily
dressing changes and monitoring for infection.

Patient will be discharged to rehab to improve strength and
mobility and will need follow up care with plastic surgery and
his PCP.

Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Gram-negative sepsis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 18-year-old
male with no significant past medical history aside from an
""innocent"" heart murmur diagnosed as a child.  He was in his
usual state of health until six days prior to admission when
he began experiencing a sore throat.

Three days prior to admission, he began experiencing fever,
chills, malaise, sweats, and right sided chest pain.  Twelve
days prior to admission, the patient had been to the dentist
and had work done on his teeth.  The patient went to his PCP
three days prior to admission and was diagnosed with
mononucleosis.  At that time he had a white blood cell count
of 26.  The patient continued to feel poorly with shortness
of breath, chest pain, cough, and fever.

Two days prior to admission, the patient presented to [**Hospital1 51631**] Hospital, where a chest x-ray showed a possible
pneumonia.  The patient was started on azithromycin and
ceftriaxone.  He was noted to have a fever of 103.  He was
admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital, where a followup chest CT scan
showed septic emboli bilaterally.  Followup blood cultures
grew 4/4 bottles of gram-positive cocci identified as group-C
Strep and one bottle grew gram-negative rods consistent with
fusobacterium.  The patient was given Vancomycin, Zosyn, and
clindamycin.  The patient continued to be dyspneic, and was
transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department at 2 am on [**7-24**].

On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient's
temperature was 99.8, his blood pressure was 112/45, heart
rate 133, respiratory rate was 30, and he was sating 96% on
room air.  In the Emergency Department, he was put on 6
liters of oxygen and then continued to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was put on
100% nonrebreather mask.  His arterial blood gas showed a pH
of 7.33, a pCO2 of 52, a pAO2 of 210.  Chest x-ray showed
bilateral effusions with right greater than left and a
density of the right lung base.

Echocardiogram was done for the concern of possible septic
endocarditis which showed a thickened pulmonic valve and a
possible vegetation.  No PDA.  Left ventricular function was
globally depressed with the left ventricular ejection
fraction of 45-50%.  The patient underwent thoracentesis in
the Emergency Room and pleural fluid showed a severe
parapneumonic effusion with a pH of 7.17, white blood cell
count of 2,350, a LDH of 2,860.

The patient's breathing remained labored in the Emergency
Room and the decision was made to intubate the patient.
Followup chest CT scan showed a possible right upper lobe
pleural based opacity consistent with a septic embolus in the
lung.  Blood cultures from [**Hospital1 1562**] revealed gram-negative
rods anaerobic bottle thought to be fusobacterium.

Leg pain and swelling along with the fusobacterium raise
concern for internal jugular thrombus leading to a neck
ultrasound in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, which revealed
a left internal jugular clot of 1.5 cm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Murmur noted in childhood thought to
be an innocent murmur.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa with an unknown reaction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location (un) 3844**] with his
parents.  He is a recent high school graduate.  He reports
two sexual partners with protection and denies IV drug use.
Denies tobacco.  Admits to occasional alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam on admission, the
patient's temperature was 101.8, heart rate was 122, blood
pressure 110/39.  His respiratory rate was 22, and his oxygen
saturation was 100% on ventilatory support.  In general, the
patient was an ill appearing young male lying in bed,
intubated, and lightly sedated on propofol.  On head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination, his pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  His sclerae
were anicteric.  Oropharynx are dry with no exudates.  Neck
was supple with tenderness to palpation noted on the left
side greater than the right side and tenderness to rotation
on the left with left anterior cervical adenopathy.  The left
side of the neck was erythematous and warm to touch.  Chest
examination revealed bronchial breath sounds and dullness
half way up on the right side and dullness to the left base
with crackles a third of the way up on the left.  Abdominal
examination was soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen with
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities examination showed no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  No Osler's, [**Last Name (un) 1003**], or
splinter hemorrhages.  Skin examination revealed linear
erythematous papular rash on the trunk at the level of T12 in
a dermatomal pattern.

LABORATORIES AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  Laboratories in the
Emergency Department revealed a sodium of 132, potassium 4.2,
a chloride of 98, bicarb of 23, BUN of 28, and creatinine of
1.0, glucose of 92, ALT is 30, AST of 57, alkaline
phosphatase of 89, total bilirubin 0.9, amylase of 42, a CPK
of 238 with a MB fraction of 3, and a troponin of less than
0.3.  PT of 12.5, PTT of 29.3.  White count was 19.9,
hematocrit was 39, and platelets were 104.

Chest CT scan on admission revealed bilateral pleural
effusions right greater than left with fluid tracking to the
major fissure on the right.  In addition, a right upper lobe
peripherally based patchy opacity.  Small focus patchy
opacities were scattered throughout both lungs.  There was no
consolidation noted at the bases.

A CT scan of the abdomen was read as within normal limits.  A
CT scan of the pelvis was read as within normal limits.  A CT
scan of the head revealed no hemorrhage, no mass effect or
shift and clear paranasal sinuses.  The bone windows on the
CT scan of the pelvis were read as no lytic or blastic
lesions noted.

A neck ultrasound revealed partially occluded thrombus in the
left internal jugular vein with flow around the thrombus.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient is an 18-year-old male with some
history what he felt previously to be an innocent heart
murmur.  He presented 12 days after a dental cleaning with
fevers, cough, positive blood cultures, and a bedside
echocardiogram suspicious for a pulmonic thrombic lesion.
Considered was endocarditis with septic emboli to the lungs,
however, a neck ultrasound revealed a left internal jugular
clot and this was thought to be the source of septic emboli.

Thus, the patient was given the diagnosis of Lemierre's
syndrome.

PROBLEM LIST BY SYSTEM:
1. Lemierre's with septic pulmonary emboli (septic
thrombophlebitis of internal jugular vein).  Infectious
Disease was immediately consulted and recommended treatment
with ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and gentamicin to cover group C
Streptococcus and anaerobic gram-negative rods.  A head,
chest, pelvis, abdomen CT scan was done to evaluate for a
possible further emboli.  The CT scan showed no lesions in
the head, abdomen, or pelvis with multiple nodules in the
lungs consistent with septic emboli and decreased signal in
the left internal jugular vein.

Ultrasound of the neck showed a 1.5 mm clot in the left
internal jugular vein.  Xigris was considered for sepsis, but
the patient did not meet the criteria as he is not in shock,
and there was concern for anticoagulation with his bloody
thoracentesis fluid.

Cultures were requested from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
Otolaryngology was consulted to evaluate for possible
internal jugular vein ligation.  They recommended
Heparinization to prevent propagation of the clot and
mentioned that surgery was not indicated unless the clot
progressed after 24 hours of antibiotics.  Therefore, a
repeat ultrasound was planned for 24 hours.

The patient remained febrile overnight with a maximum
temperature of 105.0 and a steady temperature of 102.4.  The
patient received a cooling blanket.

A morning chest x-ray was more worrisome for increased
pulmonary emboli and increased pleural effusions.  Infectious
Disease recommended starting acyclovir at 900 mg IV for a
possible herpetic rash.  The following day, ultrasound showed
extension of the clot past the mandible.  The proximal
thrombosis was not visualized with decreased flow noted in
the internal jugular vein with near total occlusion.
Otolaryngology felt that internal jugular ligation was not
warranted at that time.  They recommended ordering a
transesophageal echocardiogram and a MRV/MRA to evaluate for
excessive fluid collection and documentation of further
pulmonary events.

The transesophageal echocardiogram showed no signs of
vegetation on any of the valves of the heart.  MRV/MRA of the
chest and neck showed left lower lobe collapse, smaller
embolic events on the left.

Since the patient was not improving, his antibiotic coverage
was changed to penicillin, gentamicin, and Flagyl.  When the
gram-negative rods was identified at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital as
Porphyromonas asatchrolytica (bacteroides species) on
[**2151-7-26**] for increased efficacy.

Otolaryngology was being consulted in light of the poor CT
scan of the chest and worry of continuous septic emboli.
They recommended that surgery would not improve clinical
outcome.  Heparin was started and initially discontinued for
seizure-like activity. A followup CT scan of the head was
negative for bleed.

A MRV in diffusion lighted scan was read as extensive
internal jugular vein involvement and possible cavernous
sinus clot.  Heparin was restarted due to proposition of the
thrombus.

Neurosurgery consult was obtained and also supported in
anticoagulated the patient.  Infectious Disease recommended
stopping penicillin and clindamycin as they were seizuregenic
and restarting ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.

On [**2151-7-25**], Vancomycin was discontinued since the patient
had no signs of MRSA.  On [**2151-7-27**], ceftriaxone was changed
to penicillin 4 mg IV q4 as no seizures were noted on
followup electroencephalogram and these drugs were felt to be
the ideal drugs for the organism.

A CT scan of the neck was obtained with contrast to evaluate
for a drainable absence, no fluid collection was seen,
however, stranding in the subcutaneous fascia and thickened
cervical fascia was seen.  A repeat neck CT scan on [**7-30**] to
assess for clot progression or abscess formation showed no
progression of the clot and no abscess collection.
Therefore, the patient was continued on penicillin,
gentamicin, and metronidazole.  He was also continued on
Heparin with a goal of a PTT from 50-80.

Infectious Disease recommended a repeat MRV as well as a
repeat neck ultrasound before discharge and follow up with
Infectious Disease upon discharge.

2. Pulmonary effusions/emboli:  Thoracentesis on admission
showed a complicated pleural effusion.  Thoracic Surgery was
consulted, and placed a right chest tube which drained 310 cc
of serosanguinous fluid immediately, and 600 cc of fluid
overall.  A left chest tube was placed on [**2151-7-26**] with
drainage of 700 cc overall and expansion of the collapsed
left lower lung.  The right lower lung continued to remain
atelectatic with no further drainage.

Therefore, a repeat chest CT scan on [**2151-7-28**] was done to
evaluate the effusion, and the possibility of placing a
second right sided chest tube.  This CT scan showed a right
upper lobe embolus with cavitation and a mid sized right
effusion, large area with right lower lobe atelectasis and a
right lower lobe effusion.  CT Surgery felt that the chest
tube was in the correct place and that no further chest tubes
were warranted.

Bronchoscopy was therefore performed because of persistent
fevers and a high white count that revealed thick upper
airway secretions, but no bronchiolar plugs.  Bronchial
lavage was sent which did not reveal any organisms on Gram
stain and did not grow out any organisms.

On [**2151-8-2**], the patient's right chest tube was removed as it
had drained less than 100 cc in the last 24 hours.

3. Dermatology:  The patient was noted to have a linear
erythematous rash on his trunk in T12 dermatomal
distribution.  He was briefly on acyclovir, but a followup
HSV was negative for varicella zoster virus.

The next day vesicular erythematous lesion was also noted on
the patient's right medial shin.  There was concern for toxic
shock syndrome with the picture of fevers and rash.
Dermatology was consulted to swab these lesions.  Preliminary
cultures did not grow any herpes zoster virus, so acyclovir
was discontinued on [**2151-7-28**].  The rash on the trunk was
treated with cortisone cream per Dermatology recommendations
and was resolving on transfer to the floor.

4. Cardiac:  A transesophageal echocardiogram was done on
[**2151-7-26**] and showed no vegetations.  The patient was
maintained on Telemetry while in the MICU, and no conduction
abnormalities or electrocardiogram abnormalities were noted.

5. Neurology:  The patient was noted to have seizure-like
activity after his Heparin bolus on [**2151-7-25**].  The patient
developed fine tremors, upper extremity posturing, and
downward gaze.  A seizure evaluation by Neurology consult
recommended Dilantin loading.  The patient became hypotensive
with Dilantin and was therefore switched to fosphenytoin.  A
subsequent electroencephalogram was negative, and Neurology
recommended continuing Dilantin prophylactically and
re-evaluating when off sedation.  An anticoagulation panel
was sent and was still pending at time of transfer to the
floor.

The patient's Dilantin was discontinued on [**2151-8-2**] after
evaluation by Neurology, while the patient was awake, alert.
Electroencephalogram was repeated at this time and was
negative.

6. Pulmonary:  Patient was intubated for hypoxia and
hypercapnic respiratory failure.  The patient did well on
ventilation settings of assist control 450, 520 with 40%
FIO2.  Compliance was calculated at 26 and was thought to be
a combination of suppination, pleural effusions, septic
emboli, and fluid overload.

On [**2151-7-28**], the patient's sedation was lightened so he can
be tried on pressure support of 20 and PEEP of 5.  The
patient did well from 6 am to 4 pm, and then self extubated.
The patient was placed on 100% nonrebreather mask with oxygen
saturations from 98-100%.  Initially, the respiratory rate
was 20-40.  The patient was given Fentanyl for pain control
and improved. The patient was switched to Dilaudid for better
pain control and did well subsequently on 5 liters nasal
cannula.

7. Renal:  The patient maintained good renal function
throughout his hospital stay with no change in creatinine and
no decrease in urine output.  The patient's renal function
was monitored closely given his CT dye load, gentamicin,
Vancomycin, and acyclovir.  He was given nitrite boluses and
................

8. The patient received prophylactic proton-pump inhibitor on
Heparin during his MICU stay.

9. Pain control:  After the patient extubated and woke up,
pain control became an issue.  The patient was initially
started on Fentanyl, but due to decreased pain control and
increased nausea, he was switched to Dilaudid.  The patient
did better on Dilaudid PCA with decreased nausea and much
better pain control.

The patient was discharged to the floor on [**2151-8-2**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Metronidazole 500 q8.
2. Gentamicin 450 mg q24h IV.
3. Penicillin 4 units IV q4.
4. Lamivudine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **].
5. Dilaudid PCA.
6. Heparin at [**2098**] units per hour.
7. Ativan 1 mg tid.
8. Regular insulin-sliding scale.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to floor.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Lemierre's syndrome.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to have a followup chest CT scan
prior to discharge.  In addition, he was to have a followup
MRV of the neck and ultrasound of the neck prior to
discharge.  The patient was to followup with Infectious
Disease after discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with pulmonary fibrosis, prior CVA
with resultant aphasia, HTN, and DM who presented to [**Hospital1 **]-N in
respiratory distress and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory
failure thought to be secondary to aspiration. She had a history
of swallowing problems related to her prior CVA, as well as
progressing pulmonary fibrosis contributing to baseline poor
pulmonary function. She was admitted intubated after sudden
onset of hypoxic respiratory failure. Given recent
hospitalization, she was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for
aspiration/HCAP treatment. Mini-BAL was performed and cultures
revealed yeast. Her hypotension was from septic shock from a
pulmonary source. She was hypotensive on arrival to [**Hospital1 **]-N
requiring pressure support with Dopamine, then Levophed. She was
volume resuscitated with 4 L of NS and initially continued on
Levophed 0.04 delivered peripherally upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. Her
son (healthcare proxy) requested no central venous catheters,
pressors, or escalation of care. She was weaned off Levophed and
hypotension was managed with fluid boluses. In preparation for
extubation she was diuresed with Lasix drip. During her ICU stay
the patient began to experience large amounts of diarrhea. Stool
was sent for C difficile toxin assay, which was negative X 2.
Given her impressive leukocytosis, she was started on empiric
therapy with PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl. C difficile PCR was
sent. She had anion Gap metabolic acidosis secondary to lactic
acidosis with a lactate of 4.8. She was volume resuscitated as
above and acidosis resolved. On admission, sodium was 160 which
was likely an acute rather than chronic elevation. She appeared
grossly volume depleted suggesting hypovolemic hypernatremia.
She received 4L NS prior to arrival and was treated with DW5
with correction of serum sodium. The patient's left wrist was
noted to be swollen with overlying hematoma on presentation. An
x-ray was obtained that revealed a comminuted intra-articular
Colles fracture. Orthopedics was consulted and performed a
bedside reduction. Her clinic condition improved moderately and
she was able to be called out to the floor on [**2197-5-13**]. She was
extubated on [**2197-5-12**]. Goals of care were changed to CMO per
family wishes. All of her medications were discontinued except
morphine. Foley catheter and rectal tube remained for comfort.
She became DNR/Do not re intubate. She was transferred back to
her nursing home under hospice care.

Pending at the time of discharge: PCR of the stool for c
difficile.

The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with septal,
anterior and apical akinesis with hypokinesis elsewhere (LVEF=
15 %). Cannot exclude apical thrombus. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-5-27**],
ventricular function appears similar. Estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is an 81 yo male with h/o A fib, CAD, ischemic EF 20%,
TIA in [**2194-2-23**], and recent GI illness who presents with
hypotension likely secondary to cardiogenic shock.
.
1. Cardiogenic shock:  Hypotension was suspected to be secondary
to poor EF. No evidence of infection or other cause of
hypotension at the time.  ECHO showed EF of 15% with severely
depressed LV function.  BP temporarily supported with pressors.
A thalium cardiac imaging test was done to determine if the
patient would benefit from reperfusion. It was decided that
patient would not benefit from this procedure and was medically
managed instead. Patient's perfusion and blood pressure
improved, best seen in improved creatinine. Patient is on
beta-blocker, ACE-I, and aspirin. Patient and family decided to
become DNR/DNI and go home with hospice.
.
2. Afib: Patient is on carvedilol, amiodarone, digoxin, and
coumadin.  INR therapeutic at discharge.
.
3. Poor po intake: This has been an ongoing issue for the
patient. Palliative care was consulted. They recommended reglan
and ritalin. Protonix was increased as well. Given goals of
care, no feeding tube was persued.
.
4. ARF: Resolved with diuresis and improved forward flow
.
5. Urinary tract infection: Patient on a 10 day course of
cefpodoxime
.
6. Leukocytosis: Patient has had leukocytosis throughout
admission even prior to development of UTI. This is an ongoing
issue. No other active source of infection other than UTI.
.
7. Tachy-brady syndrome: Patient has ICD/pacemaker placed.
Daughter would like to leave ICD/pacemaker placed until further
discussion with patient and family.
.
8. CAD: Given time lapse since last stent, Plavix was
discontinued. Patient will continue on ASA, beta-blocker, and
ACE-I. It was decided no overall benefit in revascularization.
.
9. Hyponatremia: Stable prior to discharge. Likely [**2-24**] CHF.
.
10. Elevated LFTs: Likely [**2-24**] congestive hepatopathy. Stable
during this hospitalization.
.
11. BPH: Continue finasteride
.
12. Seronegative RA: Continue home hydroxychloroquine and
prednisone
.
# GERD/hiatal hernia: Increased Protonix to 40mg po qday
.
# Eye drops: Continue home eye drops
.
# Depression: Stopped remeron [**2-24**] sedation for 24 hours when
given remeron in MICU. Palliative care consult done. Started
Ritalin.
.
# Code: Patient made DNR/DNI and will go home with hospice

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6129**] is a 77yo female with PMH significant for COPD on 4L
NC, HTN, anemia, and recent pubic ramus fracture who was
recently in the MICU for hypoxia, hypotension and thought to
have urosepsis.  At that time, she was stared on broad spectrum
antibiotics (Vancomycin/Cefepime) and narrowed to cefpodoxime on
discharge, to complete a 7-day course.  She was discharged to
rehab on [**2101-7-7**].  At rehab on [**2101-7-8**], she was found by
family members to be lethargic, somnolent, and tachypneic.  She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
In the ED, initial vitals were T:97.9 BP:70/38 HR:73 RR:16
O2Sat:97% on RA.  For the hypotension, she was given 5 litres
resuscitative crystalloid and a left IJ central line was placed,
after unsuccessful attempt at right IJ.  Patient was also found
to have abdominal tenderness and an abdominal CT scan was
ordered, and per our wet read, showed dilated colon, with stool
throughout.  She was given Vancomycin and
Piperacillin-Tazobactam x 1 dose after blood and urine cultures
were sent.  She was then transferred to MICU.

Relevant Imaging:
1)CT abd/pelvis ([**7-8**]): 1. Subacute fractures of the left
superior and inferior and right superior pubic rami with
evidence of interval callus formation. Findings were discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6133**] at 10 pm on [**2101-7-8**].
2. No acute intra-abdominal process is identified.
3. Interval improvement of airspace process at lung bases
bilaterally. Stable small pleural effusions

2)Cxray ([**7-8**]): There is persistent left retrocardiac opacity,
accompanied by basilar atelectasis and small effusion; pneumonic
consolidation cannot be excluded. Right basilar subsegmental
atelectasis is unchanged, but there is no new focal airspace
process elsewhere. There is some upper zone pulmonary vascular
redistribution, but no overt edema. Right hilar prominence is
unchanged, corresponding to known dilated right pulmonary
artery. There is a suggestion of gas-distended bowel loops in
the upper abdomen, but no definite free subdiaphragmatic gas.

ecg [**7-27**]: Wide complex tachycardia, likely atrial flutter with
2:1 conduction and
aberrancy. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2101-7-27**] atrial flutter is similar.
.
cxr [**7-28**]: Wide complex tachycardia, likely atrial flutter with
2:1 conduction and

tte: IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with
preserved global biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated
ascending aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 6129**] is a 77yo female with PMH as
listed above who presented with hypotension.  She was treated
broadly initially for sepsis, and it was determined that the
likely source was C.difficile colitis.  Her toxin B was
eventually positive.  She had respiratory failure in the setting
of septic shock.  She had persistent hypotension while
intubated, and required vasopressors.  She completed a two week
course of antibiotics for her c.dif colitis.

She developed diffuse anasarca from volume resuscitation.  It
became difficult to mobilize her fluids because she was felt to
be intravascularly dry.  Eventually, a lasix drip was started,
and she was successfully extubated.

She was also noted to be severely hypothyroid (her replacement
medications had been stopped for some reason prior to
admission).  She was started on IV synthroid after consultation
with endocrinology.

In addition to her fluid overload state, she was very weak.  She
was receiving enteral nutrition during most of her stay, but
remained very weak.

She also had a pleural effusion that was tapped and was
transudative after analysis.  It was felt to be due to volume
resucitiation and diastolic heart failure.  The fluid
reaccumulated.

She also developed a GI bleed, which was felt to be due to an
upper source, and GI was consulted.  They recommended supportive
care, and that an urgent endoscopy / colonoscopy would not alter
her course.

Once she was extubated, she had an acute event of possible
aspiration vs. flash pulmonary edema that lead to her being
re-intubated.  She had difficulty weaning off of the ventilator
due to profound weakness and volume overload.

Then, she developed a tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation and
atrial flutter.  Her BP was very sensitive to this rhythm, and
she required DC cardioversion.  She was loaded on amiodarone and
esmolol, and she once again developed this tachy rhythm.  Given
that she had then completed an IV load of amiodarone, DC
cardioversion was done again, and she returned to sinus
bradycardia with a good BP.

Given that her heart had become somewhat unstable, and there was
very little progress in weaning her from the ventilator, family
discussions were held regularly to discuss goals of care.  Then,
at a meeting one day prior to her death, the decision was made
by her daughter and HCP, as well as her husband, to gather
family and to terminally extubate her.  This was done on 6/ 27/
08 at 6pm, and she expired with her entire family at her bedside
very peacefully by 6:20pm.

She remained on DVT prophylaxis during the stay.  Other issues,
such as pain control for her hip fracture, were adequately
addressed.  She was given insulin, bronchodilators, mouth care,
pressure ulcer prophylaxis.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 56 year-old woman with a history of HCV and
autoimmune heptatis with a baseline MELD score of 32 and
previous admissions for hepatic encephalopathy, who was brought
into the [**Hospital1 18**] ED at the urging of her visting nurse this
morning. Her visiting nurse, who sees her twice a week to check
her weight, temperature, and blood pressure, noticed today that
her temperature was 100.5 and that she seemed ""not herself"". She
advised Mrs. [**Known lastname 1968**] to seek medical attention.
.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1968**] acknowledges that at baseline she has some
""confusion"" due to her hepatitis, and sometimes ""doesn't think
clearly"". She states that over the last few days she has felt
more confused than normal, but was unable to provide any
specifics on why she thought she had been more confused. Per her
daughter, her current affect, slow speech, and confusion are
near or at her baseline level, but her confusion is easily
exacerbated if she does not take her lactulose every three
hours.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were T 101 HR 99 BP 113/40 RR 18
O2 sat 98 on room air. Her physical exam was notable for a mild
abdominal fluid wave, and she was noted to be ""slow speaking"".
An initial work up for her fever was begun, which inlcuded an
rapid influenza antigen test, and broad spectrum antibiotics to
cover both possible meningitis (given her confusion) and
spontaneous bacterial peritonits. An LP was not obatined to rule
out meningitis given her high INR (4.0). A head CT and chest
X-ray were read as normal, and an abdominal US showed no
baseline change from recent imaging.
.
On reveiw of systems, she denies any chest pain, shortness of
breath, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits or
urine habits (of note, she states that her urine has been ""dark
colored"" for several years). She did endorse of feeling of
abdominal pain, which she states starts in her abdomen and
radiates down to both feet bilaterally, and which she first
noted in the ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICINE SERVICE COURSE:

56 year-old woman with a history of HCV and autoimmune hepatatis
with a baseline MELD score of 32, on liver and kidney [**Month/Day/Year **]
list and previous admissions for hepatic encephalopathy, who was
admitted on [**9-27**] for fever and altered mental status. Her VNA
found her to be confused on the day of admission, with a T of
100.5.
.
The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone empirically
for SBP from [**9-27**] to [**10-1**]. She has completed a 2nd course of
ceftriaxone and 1 course of Vancomycin empirically for SBP on
[**10-7**] to [**10-14**]. She has not had a documented fever during her
nearly 3 week hospital stay.
.
She has had some mild vaginal bleeding during her
hospitalization. She has received 2u PRBCs early in her
hospitalization, and then again 2 units [**10-16**].
.
She triggered evening of [**10-12**] for altered mental status.
Started on empiric linezolid for VRE in urine. This was stopped
on [**10-14**]. KUB performed for abdominal distension, though no SBO.
On [**10-15**] with AMS, her lactulose was increased to 60mg po q3h
and transferred to the ICU for further management.
.
In the MICU, the patient had her INR corrected and had a LIJ
placed and dobhoff placed on [**2137-10-16**]. Diagnostic paracentesis
was negative. FT placed. Mental status improved slightly.
.
She was transferred back to the floor and noted to have slurred
speech and tangential thoughts. She denies pain, SOB, nausea,
HA, cough. States she has chills and dry mouth.

##################
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4869**]

Upon transfer to the Hepatorenal service, the patient was alert,
awake, and oriented to name, place, and time. She was treated
for the following issues:

ESLD: The patient was intermittently encephalopathic during her
admission, especially when she was not given her lactulose
strictly Q3 hrs. She was also continued on rifaximin. Her MELD
scores were generally above 40 though had improved to 35 on the
day of transfer, in the setting of an acute improvement in her
creatinine. Her bilirubin had climbed to 24.0 on day of
transfer. Her INR was consistently elevated, and she required
occasional doses of FFP to reverse her INR when she developed
low-grade bleeding from the corner of her mouth and lips. She
also had regular vaginal spotting nightly, though no frank
hemorrhage. Her fibrinogen was also occasionally found to be
<100, and was given several units of cryoprecipitate. OB/Gyn saw
the patient for a potential endometrial biopsy as part of the
pre-[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] evaluation, though the risks of the procedure
were thought to outweigh the pre-test probability of finding any
malignancy, especially given the patient's chronic femara
(believed to be protective against endometrial malignancy). Her
ascites worsened steadily, and she had tenderness to
palpation/percussion. She had no respiratory compromise, and had
consistently excellent oxygen saturation. Diagnostic
paracentesis was not performed given high INR and risk of
bleeding. She was instead given a seven day course of empiric
ceftriaxone. Her diuretics were held for the duration of her
time on the hepatorenal service, given her acute kidney injury.

# Right wrist hematoma: The patient triggered for altered mental
status on the evening of [**10-12**]. She had an ABG performed, and
subsequently developed a hematoma. Her hand was felt to be cold
and plastic/hand surgery was consulted. They did not believe she
had compartment syndrome, and her U/S was negative for DVT or
pseudoaneurysm. She was followed with serial hand
sensation/strength exams.

# Angioedema: On [**10-10**] the patient was found to have periorbital
and lip/face edema, concerning for angioedema. She was given
benadryl and IV steroids. She did not have any respiratory
compromise. The precipitant was unclear, and was ultimately
believed to be a lidoderm patch that she had received 2 days
prior, for abdominal pain. After discontinuing the lidoderm, the
patient did not have further episodes of angioedema.

# UTI: The patient's urine culture on [**10-5**] grew coag negative
staph and enterococcus. She completed seven day course of
vancomycin. Subsequent urine cultures were negative. Linezolid
was started for the patient's [**10-12**] trigger (altered MS), given
the culture data. The linezolid was discontinued on [**10-14**].

# Anemia: The patient had a generally stable hematocrit and did
not require frequent blood transfusions. She had guaiac positive
stool on [**10-14**]. She was continued on her regular dose of
erythropoeitin, and her aspirin and warfarin (for portal vein
thrombosis) were held. She had low-grade vaginal and
oropharyngeal bleeding, as above. She was also continued on
daily PO vitamin K, and was given 5 mg of IV vitamin K on day of
transfer to MICU, in anticipation of IR-guided line placement
and paracentesis.

# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level
was 2.6 on admission. It peaked at 3.1 on [**9-29**]. She was placed
on octreotide and midodrine, and received daily doses of IV
albumin. Her creatinine improved to 1.5 on day of transfer to
the MICU, but her midodrine regimen was occasionally interrupted
secondary to hypertension. Her albumin infusions were stopped
when the patient became hypertensive and volume overloaded. Her
urine output was low, but unreliably measured, and frequently
mixed in with loose stools. She had a foley placed on day of
transfer to the MICU.

# Hypernatremia: Her sodium levels trended up to 150 on day of
transfer to the MICU, which may have contributed to her mental
status. She was started on a D5W fluid infusion.

# Diabetes Mellitus: As the patient's blood sugars generally
trended downward, her home basal glargine was steadily decreased
from her home basal 35 units QHS, to avoid hypoglycemic
episodes. On the day of transfer to the MICU, her glargine was
written for 25 units QHS. She was written for a low-protein,
diabetic diet.

# History of Breast Cancer: The patient was continued on her
home dose of letrozole. She has a history of lymphedema in her
left arm, and blood draws were avoided in the left arm.

# Access: The patient had an EJ line placed in her right neck,
and also had a peripheral IV placed on her right arm. At the
time of transfer to the MICU, there was a plan in place for the
patient to receive vitamin K via the IV, and have her
coagulation studies checked overnight, with FFP/cryoprecipitate
given as needed to reduce her INR to <2.0. Angio and ultrasound
were contact[**Name (NI) **] to arrange central venous line vs PICC placement
and diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis on the morning of [**10-15**].
At the time of transfer, the interventional radiologists were
planning to perform both procedures at 8:00 on [**10-15**].

####################
MICU GREEN COURSE

On the floor, she was noted to be more confused and oozing blood
from venous access sites, mouth and vagina. There was no blood
in rectal tube. Her abd was noted to be more distended. KUB
showed distention of the stomach and colon w/o air-fluid levels.

.
She was transferred to the MICU and NGT is placed which
aspirates blood. She is intubated and a cordis is placed for
rapid resucitation. She became hypotense to SBP 67. She was
given 3U PRBCs, 4U FFP, 1U cryo and started on dopamine drip.
CVP was noted to be elevated to 30s and heart was enlarged on
CXR so stat echo was ordered and showed no effusion but PASP
40-48 with a normal LVEF. She had EGD by GI which showed diffuse
oozing in the stomach which had stopped.
.
On [**10-18**], she continued to bleed. She was aggressively
transfused with FFP/cryp/PRBC/plt with goals Hct > 25, fib >
100, plt > 50, INR < 2.  A Cordis and A-line were placed.  Her
CT Abdomen showed moderate to large amount of ascites. No bowel
obstruction and no free air.  Her bladder pressures were
monitored with plan to para for > 30.  ENT scoped and packed
nares.

On [**10-19**], a temp femoral line placed by renal and CVVH started.
She received 3 U blood, 2 FFP, 1 PLT. Smear reviewed by heme:
some schistocytes c/w light degree of DIC.

On [**10-20**], ENT again packed bilateral nares.  She received total
7u FFP, 1u PRBCs.  SQ methylnaltrexone was given for trace
stool.  Her abd was more distended, with bladder pressure
overnight 21.  KUB showed ground glass ascites, less distended
stomach air bubble, no signs of free air or obstruction.  Her
lactate was trending upwards into 8s; unclear etiology at this
point, but probably bowel related vs. secondary to liver disease
and inability to clear lactate.

On [**10-21**], she continued to have escilating pressor requirements.
 She began to develop NSVT with associated blood pressure drops.
 She was started on amiodorone and given lidocaine boluses.  Her
NSVT normalized for a few hours.  She was then found to be in
pulseless VT.  She had return of spontaneos circulation with DC
cardioversion.  She continued to go into and out of VT.  In
discussion with the family, she was made DNR/DNI.  Pressors were
continued but no further shocks were given.  Her blood pressure
slowly declined and she passed away in no apparent distress at 6
AM on [**10-22**].

History of Present Illness:
Please see the medicine nightfloat admission note for full
details. In brief, this is an 81yo man w/ systolic/diastolic CHF
(EF 45%, dry weight 215lbs in [**Month (only) **]), HTN, Afib on coumadin and
vascular dementia, admitted for altered mental status, this
morning being transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.
.
He was last well about 10 days ago when he initially had urinary
retention c/b UTI and altered mental status. He improved quickly
with antibiotics and went to rehab on PO antibiotics. [**2133-5-8**] he
had low BPs and altered mental status. CXR showed PNA, and he
was started on ceftriaxone/azithro with improvement. Yesterday
morning he was again altered, could not get out of bed, and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED he triggered for hypoxia that improved with 6L O2 by
NC. Given vanc/levo/flagyl. Trop 0.08 and BNP >9000. Given ASA,
but not Lasix because of concern for infection/sepsis. On the
floor overnight he was appearing improved and was given lasix
20mg IV x1. He had an unwitnessed fall early this morning and
was found on the ground. At 7am he was again hypoxic with an
arterial P02 59 on a non-rebreather. He is profoundly confused,
oriented x0 and having trouble speaking.
.
Speaking with his wife, he usually lives in [**Hospital3 **] with
her, is oriented x3, walks with a walker, and had been
hospitalized very little before the last 3 weeks. He had never
been hospitalized before 3 weeks ago. He is DNR/DNI, but she
would like him to get all of the care necessary to improve his
current status short of intubation.


Past Medical History:
1.) Chronic permanent AF, on warfarin/BB.
2.) Combined systolic/diastolic heart failure
3.) Presumed CAD, s/p inferior MI by imaging.
4.) Vascular dementia.
5.) HTN
6.) Recent urosepsis precipitated by urinary retention s/p
hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **] with Foley catheter in place


Social History:
Retired. Married to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Known lastname 71190**], [**Name Initial (MD) **] retired RN. Children live in

CXR Portable [**2133-5-14**]:
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are profoundly diminished. The patient
was imaged in
a somewhat lordotic position. There is diffuse interstitial
opacity with
cephalad flow most consistent with volume overload likely due to
congestive heart failure. Aortic tortuosity is present with
calcified plaque seen at the arch. The cardiac silhouette size
is difficult to assess but is enlarged.  There is right pleural
effusion with fluid tracking within the minor and major
fissures. A left pleural effusion cannot be entirely excluded.
There is poor visualization of the retrocardiac lung, possibly
due to atelectasis and/or edema. No pneumothorax is noted. The
bones are diffusely osteopenic with degenerative changes noted
in both shoulder joints.
IMPRESSION: Findings most compatible with congestive heart
failure.
Correlate clinically. Repeat radiography after appropriate
diuresis
recommended to assess for underlying infection.

CT HEAD NON-CONTRAST [**2133-5-16**]:
FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or evidence for
acute vascular territorial infarction is present. There is no
shift of normally midline structures and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation appears well preserved.  There is prominence of
the ventricles and the sulci compatible with parenchymal
atrophy. There are periventricular white matter hypodensities
compatible with small vessel microvascular disease. However, no
acute infarcts are present. Osseous structures appear intact and
the visualized sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. Parenchymal
atrophy and small vessel microvascular disease but no acute
intracranial findings.

SWALLOWING VIDEO FLUOROSCOPY [**2133-5-21**]:
Swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with
the speech and swallow department. Multiple consistencies of
barium were administered.  There was aspiration and penetration
to thin liquids.

ECG, [**2133-5-14**]:
The underlying rhythm is probably atrial fibrillation. Left axis
deviation. Intraventricular conduction defect. One ventricular
premature beat is seen. Lateral ST-T wave changes likely due to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year-old man w/ systolic/diastolic CHF (EF 45%, dry weight
215 lbs. in [**1-/2132**]), HTN, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and
vascular dementia, admitted for altered mental status,
transferred to the MICU for altered mental status and hypoxia.
.
# Hypoxia: Most likely due to combination of acute
decompensation of his CHF in the setting of diastolic
dysfunction secondary to afib with RVR, as well as healthcare
acquired pneumonia.   HCAP: Patient completed a 8-day course of
cefepime/vancomycin and was afebrile with normal WBC on
discharge. Acute on chronic CHF: He received several doses of 40
IV Lasix. Subsequently, his exam appeared more dry so lasix was
held. On discharge, he weighed 185 lbs and was 93-96% on RA. He
will require daily standing weights, ins/outs monitoroing,
volume assessment, and every other day (until stabilized)
electrolytes monitoring. He can be restarted on his home dose of
furosemide 40 mg daily for a goal of maintaining euvolemia.
.
# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: Patient is extremely sensitive
to metabolic insult, and has had wide fluctuations in his mental
status with his recent infections and CHF exacerbation. CT head
w/o contrast did not show acute process. Scopolamine patch was
apparently given at rehab facility, and also likely contributed;
this was discontinued. When he was able to take POs, home doses
of Donepezil and Memantine were restarted.
.
# Afib on coumadin: Coumadin initially held for supertherapeutic
INR (3.5).  He was started on IV Metoprolol as he was unable to
take POs.  He was then transitioned to PO metoprolol (increased
from 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]), and his heart rate remained
well-controlled. His Coumadin was re-started at home dose of 2.5
mg, then increased to 3 mg on [**2133-5-22**]; INR at discharge is 1.6.
INR will need to be checked on [**5-25**] and thereafter as needed for
goal of INR [**1-8**].
.
# Urinary Retention: Patient underwent Foley catheter placement
after repeatedly failing voiding trials. Etiologies include BPH
vs recent scopolamine patch.  He underwent and failed a repeat
voiding trial with PVR 700 [**2133-5-22**], and underwent TID straight
catheterization thereafter. He was continued on Flomax with
up-titrated dose (0.8 mg). As straight catheterization not
available at rehab, a foley catheter was placed prior to
transfer and will remain in place until follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in Urology on [**2133-6-2**].
.
#) Acute renal failure: His creatinine trended up from a
baseline of 1.0 to 1.6 in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
FeNa of 0.45% was consistent with pre-renal intravascular
depletion. He was hydrated with gentle IVF. ACE inhibitor and
furosemide were held and medications renally dosed. Creatinine
was stable (1.6) at time of discharge, up from baseline of 1.0.
His ACE-I may be restarted as outpatient when his creatinine
returns to baseline. His renal function should be monitored at
the rehab every other day as needed until improved.
.
#) Nutrition: Due to suspicion of aspiration, the patient was
evaluated by speech and swallow and underwent a video swallowing
study that showed evidence of aspiration with thin liquids. He
was started on a Pureed (dysphagia) diet with Nectar
prethickened liquids, which he tolerated. His medications were
crushed.  \
.
# S/p fall: patient found down [**5-15**] on the floor. Not
complaining of focal pain, but he has difficulty cooperating
fully with a neurologic exam.  He does open eyes to command and
squeeze fingers when asked. CT head without acute ICH.
.
#) Hyperlipidemia:  Patient was continued on home dose of 5mg
simvastatin when able to tolerate POs.
.
#) Gout: Allopurinol renally dosed. Can increase to usual 400 mg
daily as renal function improves.
.
#) Outpatient management: Once admitted to rehab, the patient
needs every other day blood labs to monitor serum electrolytes,
creatinine, INR, and daily weights.  Plan to monitor volum
status clinically to reach a balance between his CHF and renal
failure. Outpatient urology follow-up as above.

Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
O2 saturation: 93-95% on RA at rest.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with altered mental status and
shortness of breath. You were found to have a pneumonia and too
much fluid in your lungs (heart failure exacerbation). You were
given antibiotics for 8 days for the pneumonia, as well as
medication to help remove the extra fluid. Your symptoms
improved and you were discharged to a rehab facility. We also
monitored you for worsened kidney function; this was stable on
discharge.

In the setting of your acute illness, there was concern for your
ability to swallow liquids/food without aspirating. You were
evaluted by the swallowing team and underwent a swallowing
study. You aren't able to swallow well when you drink thin
liquids (water), so you will need to continue to crush your
pills and stay on a puree diet.

We made the following changes to your home medications:
1. We increased Tamsulosin (Flomax) to 0.8 mg instead of 0.4 mg
2. We increased Metoprolol to 25 mg twice daily instad of 12.5
mg twice daily
3. We have held your furosemide (Lasix) for now; this can be
restarted as needed at your rehab.
4. We decreased your allopurinol to 150 mg daily instead of 400
mg daily until your kidney function improves
5. We stopped your scopalamine patch

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 47790**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2193-12-17**] for further
management of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner iin cluding a carotid duplex
ultrasound which showed a bilateral internal carotid artery
1-39% stenosis with mild/moderate plaque, a right vertebral
artery occlusion and a normal left vertebral artery. Vein
mapping was performed which showed small bilateral greater
saphenous veins and no lesser saphenous veins. Plavix was
allowed to clear from his system. The renal service was
consulted for assitance with his hemodialysis and he continued
on his schedule. On [**2193-12-21**], Mr. [**Known lastname 47790**] was noted to have a
slight troponin rise and nitroglycerin as well as heperain were
started. As he did have some chest pain with slight ST
elevations, it was decided to take him urgently to the operating
room for revascularization where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to four vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taklen to the intensive care
unit for monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. He underwent hemodialysis. The
electrophysiology service interrogated his ICD. On postoperative
day three, Mr. [**Known lastname 47790**] was transferred to the step down unit for
further recovery. He was noted to have difficulty swallowing and
was assessed by speechand swallow, who recommended that he
receive nutrition via feeding tube. He progressed slowly with
physical therapy. On POD6 he was noted to have a rising white
blood cell count and his CXR showed right lower lobe infiltrate,
which was felt to be aspiration PNA. He was started on antibx
and transferred back to the ICU for pulmonary toilet. General
surgewry was consulted and on POD 11 a PEG feeding tube was
placed. He continued to make slow progress and on POD15/5 he was
transferred to rehabilitation at [**Hospital3 **] in
[**Location (un) 1294**]

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hepatobiliary service on
[**2106-12-11**].  His encephalopathy was thought to be baseline as well
as due to dehydration.  A RUQ ultrasound revealed no portal vein
thrombosis.  He was afebrile with a normal WBC, but was
pan-cultured anyway.  UA was negative.  Hematocrit was stable at
30.  Ceftriaxone was started empirically for possible peritoneal
infection. Lactulose was continued.  He was aggressively
hydrated.  He also had a createnine of 2.1 (baseline 1.5) and a
sodium of 124 (baseline 132).  His FeNa was < 1%, so this was
likely pre-renal.  He could not have a feeding tube placed due
to recent bleeding, and required supervised oral feeding.  His
MELD on admission was 31.  Ceftriaxone was discontined HD 2 (no
signs of infection).  Lactulose was titrated so as to get [**4-9**]
BMs daily.  On HD 2, createnine was down to 1.6.  Physical
therapy saw him and felt he should progress to be discharged
home.  On HD 5, he became lightheaded and dropped to his feet
while walking.  Denied loss of consciousness.  Thought to be due
to orthostasis.  His BP was 60/palp and HR was 110.  He was
helped back to bed and his HR and BP returned to [**Location 213**] (SBP
100, HR 90).  His CMV viral load was negative.  His Hct was 22,
so he was transfused 2 units RBCs for [**Location **] loss anemia.  His
INR was 3.0, so he was transfused 3 units of FFP to correct his
coagulopathy.  A CT scan revealed a right-side retroperitoneal
hematoma.  At that time, he was transferred to the trnasplant
surgery serivce and sent to the ICU.

On HD 6, the patient was intubated.  A central venous catheter
and arterial line were placed.  From this point on, this patient
required aggressive transfusion of RBCs, FFP, platelets and
Cryo.  Over the night, his Hct dropped to 15, then rose to 18,
then 25, then 27. His platelets went fro 50 to 29 to 91 to 153.
His INR went from 3.3 to 2.8 to 2.5 to 0.6.  He required 11
units of RBCs, 2 of platelets, 4 of FFP, 1 of cryo and 1 of
factor 7.  On HD 7, his Hct dropped from 28 to 11 over 3 hours.
He did not have guiac + stools and hig NG tube outpuit was
[**Last Name (LF) 63675**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] his [**First Name3 (LF) **] loss anemia was though to be entirely
due to his retroperiotneal hematoma.  TIPS and surgery were
considered, but the mortality was thought to be too high.  Over
the day, he reuired 9 units of RBCs, 2 platelets, 4 FFP, 2 cryo
and 1 of factor 7.  A dialysis catheter was placed for CVVHD.
Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and fluconazole were begun
empirically.  The goal was to transfuse [**First Name3 (LF) **] products to keep
Hct > 27, Plt > 75, and INR < 2.0.  He required maximum pressor
support (neosynepherine, vasopressin and levophed).  Despite
extremes in transfusion of [**First Name3 (LF) **] products, we were not able to
stop his bleeding.  A family meeting was arranged and the
decision was made to hold all pressor support and [**First Name3 (LF) **]
products.  He died later that night.

History of Present Illness:
79 year-old Male with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**35**] years ago, MI and HTN
initially presented with chest pain. Pt has known 3vd, was
evaluted by cath for chest pain with a positive stress test in
[**1-27**]. Initially pt presented to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**]. He has
reportedly had chest pain intermittently for months. Chest pain
started 2 hrs prior to presentation at OSH, described as
substernal chest pressure, sudden onset and gradually worsening,
radiating to L arm. Pt denied radiation to back or tearing
senation on initial presenation to OSH ED, pain was [**8-28**]. At
OSH pt was started on nitro gtt and heparin gtt, and then was
chest pain free. EKG from OSH while chest pain showed [**Street Address(2) 2051**]
elevation in aVR, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressino in I, II, aVF, V3-V6, which
improved somewhat after chest pain free. No fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abd pain, neck pain, or other
complaints. Pain is similar to prior MI, has had episodes of
short lived chest pain intermittently since CABG but never had
to use nitroglycerin until today. Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED initial VS were 97.4 90 148/76 16 95% 3L Nasal
Cannula. Pt was initially [**12-29**] CP and then CP free here on nitro
gtt, received aspirin 325 mg as well. Cardiology consulted in ED
and recommended addition of integrillin gtt instead of plavix
given known 3vd, also received metoprolol 25 mg PO. Trop
elevated at 0.18, CK/MB flat. Admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service cath in
the am.
.
Right femoral artery was used for IABP, RHC via right femoral
vein, and Left femoral artery for PCI.   During cath, patient
had sudden onset of respiratory distress thought secondary to
CHF (ischemic-induced), this lead to intubation in the cath lab.
 RHC was done and observed a PCWP of 40, which lead to placement
of IABP.  Cath showed left main disease and OM disease, these
were interveined on sequentially.  His PCWP was noted to have
dropped to 20s at the end of the case. Findings during his LHC
included right dominant coronary arteries. LMCA with diffuse
70-80% with ostial 90%. LAD TO origin. LCX prox 70%, OM1 origin
90%. RCA proximal and ostial 50-60%. SVG none. LIMA to LAD: free
LIMA patent to LAD. He had placement of DES to LM and DES/BMS to
CX OM. He received heparin, integrilin, nitroglycerine drip,
lasix, bivalirudin, norepinephrine, cefazolin.
.
In CCU, he was intubated, sedated. The patient had an IABP in
place.
.
Per floor team, review of systems: he denies any prior history
of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

.
IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2130-10-26**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION - Selective coronary angiography
of this right dominant system revealed 3-vessel coronary artery
disease. There was an ostial 90% stenosis of the LMCA which was
diffusely diseased to 70-80%. The LAD was 100% occluded
proximally. The LMCA gave rise to a patent LCx with a proximal
70% stenosis at the take-off of OM1, which extended into OM1
narrowing the ostial segment of OM1 to 90%. There was diffuse
plaquing of the distal Lx. Venous conduit angiography was not
performed as the SVG to OM1/OM2 is known to be occluded.
Selective arterial conduit angiography of the LIMA arising from
the ascending aorta to the mid-LAD revealed this to be patent.
Initial hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated left and right
heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of
27mmHg and a mean PCW of 31 mmHg. There was mild pulmonary
artery hypertension with PA 45/30mmHg but no significant
transpulmonary gradient and a PVR of only 38dynes*sec*cm-5. The
cardiac output and index were reduced at 4.2L/min and 2.1 L/min
respectively. Repeat hemodynamics after insertion of the IABP
and baloon angioplasty of the LMCA showed a decrease in the PCW
to a mean of 18mmHg but persistently decreased mixed venous
saturation
(60%). Native 3-vessel coronary artery disease. Culprit lesion
for presentation likley 90% ostial LMCA. Respiratory failure
secondary to acute on chronic left ventricular systolic
dysfunction requiring mechanical ventilation. IABP insertion for
circulatory support in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Mild
pulmonary artery hypertension.
.
[**2130-10-27**] 2D-ECHO - Poor image quality (echo contrast used). The
left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
mid to distal septal, anterior and apuical hypokinesis
suggested. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. with borderline normal
free wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2130-10-26**] CXR (PORTABLE) - Single frontal view of the chest
demonstrates evidence of prior CABG and median sternotomy. The
lungs are mildly hyperinflated allowing for somewhat lordotic
patient positioning, suggestive of emphysema. There is minimal
interstitial edema. The heart is top normal in size. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.

Patient expired

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year-old Male with a PMH significant for coronary artery
disease (s/p CABG [**35**] years prior), prior MI, hypertension who
presented to an outside hospital with chest pain who underwent
PCI who was intubated for respiratory failure in the cardiac
catheterization lab and who required placement of an
intra-aortic balloon pump for cardiogenic shock and subsequently
expired due to ventricular tachycardia.
.
# CARDIOGENIC SHOCK - The patient presents with a known history
of ischemic cardiomyopathy, with recent EF of 35-40%. During his
left heart catheterization procedure this admission, the patient
began to experience acute respiratory failure, likely secondary
to worsening cardiogenic shock. The etiology of his cardiogenic
shock was likely secondary to a cathecholamine surge which
occurred during the catheterization procedure, as he was laid
supine. There was also a component of  anxiety associated with
the procedure. His right heart catheterization revealed a PCWP
of 31 mmHg, which was improved with the placement of an
intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to 18 mmHg. The IABP was
maintained in good position and was assisting ventricular
contraction initially at a 1:1 ratio which supported his mean
arterial pressures to an average of 55-60 mmHg. He was slowly
weaned to a 2:1 ratio over the course of 48-hours with
subsequent removal of the IABP 3-days into admission. A
Norepinphrine gtt was utilized to support his systolic pressures
and peripheral vasculature while the balloon pump was being
utilized. His systolic pressures actually remained elevated
following the removal of the device and he requried transient
use of a Nitroglycerin gtt to control his systolic pressures.
While the IABP was in place, his distal pulses were closely
monitored and daily CXRs showed adequate balloon positioning.
His platelets and hematocrit were also closely monitoring, with
a drop in his platelets from 257 to 125 this admission. He
showed no evidence of bleeding nonetheless. We added back his
home anti-hypertensives once his blood pressure stabilized and
his cardiac function improved. His digoxin level remained
therapeutic this admission. He was also treated with IV Lasix as
needed, to promote diuresis.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE AND HYPOXIA - The patient required urgent
intubation in the cardiac catheterization lab likely secondary
to pulmonary edema in the setting of his cardiogenic shock. He
received Lasix and Nitroglycerin in the cath lab, and once his
IABP was removed and diuresis was employed, he was successfully
extubated without issues. He transiently required Fentanyl and
Versed gtts to maintain sedation while intubated. Following
extubation, the patient was delirious. He had another episode of
flash pulmonary edema which was responsive to lasix,
nitroglycerin drip, morphine.
.
# CORONARIES - The patient presented with known coronary disease
involving 3-vessels. The patient was found to have a 90%
stenotic lesion of the left main coronary artery, which
underwent drug-eluting stent placement. He also has a known
history of prior CABG. Prior to his cardiac intervention, given
his chest pain, he was started on heparin gtt and maintained on
Aspirin therapy. Integrillin was added given continued chest
pain. His statin medication was optimized to high dose
Atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily. He was also Plavix loaded with 600
mg PO x 1 prior to his catheterization. Following his
catheterization, stenting and resolution of his cardiogenic
shock and removal of the balloon pump, he had no further issues
with chest pain. He will continue on Aspirin 325 mg PO daily,
Plavix 75 mg PO daily and a high dose statin medication. The
patient had an episode of VT but was hemodynamically stable
during the night of [**10-30**]. He had sudden onset of ventricular
fibrillation and was pulseless, he received ACLS including
intubation, electrical shocks, epinephrine, lidocaine,
magnesium. He was taken emergently to the cath lab, where his
LIMA was found to be occluded. The patient required IABP,
ventricular pacer wire and epinephrine drip. His family decided
to make the patient DNR and he expired on [**10-30**] around 1600.
.
# RHYTHM - The patient presented in sinus rhythm. He was
carefully monitored in the post-intervention period for the
development of arrhythmia. He was monitored via telemtry, his
electrolytes were optimized.
.
# CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY - The patient presented with an
unclear baseline, but known chronic renal insufficiency. His
last creatinine in our records was 1.4 and he presented with a
creatinine in the 1.7 range, likely secondary to forward flow
issues. His creatinine stabilized following cardiogenic shock
treatment, with improvement in his cardiac index. We avoided
nephrotoxic medications and renally dosed his medications.
.
# HYPERTENSION - hold amlodipine, valsartan, hydralazine, imdur
for now
.
# GERD - He was continued on Omeprazole at his home dosing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 53-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
multiple percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties
with stents.  He was symptom-free for two weeks status post
the last stent.  Since then, he has had progressive angina
and occasional angina at rest.  No history of orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.
Denies atrial fibrillation or transient ischemic attack.  No
claudication.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Noncontributory.

MEDICATIONS:   Aspirin 325 mg once daily, Lopressor 25 mg
twice a day, Protonix 40 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg once
daily, Norvasc 5 mg once daily.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm,
Grade I/VI systolic murmur.  Pulmonary:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities:  No edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was brought to the operating
room on [**2120-12-5**], where a coronary artery bypass graft x 4
was performed.  Left internal mammary artery went to left
anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to diagonal,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal I, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal III.  The pericardium was left open.
An arterial line and right internal jugular with a Swan-Ganz
catheter were placed.  Two atrial wires as well as two
mediastinal tubes and one pleural tube were placed.  His EBB
equals 98 minutes, XTL equals 66 minutes.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit, where he was rapidly extubated.  On postoperative
day one, his mediastinal and pleural tubes were removed.  He
was kept in the Intensive Care Unit for aggressive pulmonary
toilet on postoperative day two.  On postoperative day two,
the patient was noted to have tachycardia and diaphoresis
despite albuterol nebulizers and pain control.  He began to
become hypoxemic.  A chest x-ray revealed a consolidation
with pneumonia, for which levofloxacin and vancomycin were
started.  The patient was reintubated and was once again
stable.  A TTE performed at that time revealed right
ventricular hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation.  No
pericardial effusion, and the left ventricular ejection
fraction was preserved.

The patient was stable on the ventilator.  He was on a
Neo-Synephrine and propofol drip.  Tube feeds were started
also on postoperative day two.  The patient's hematocrit fell
to 23 on two occasions, for which he received two units of
packed red blood cells each time.  The ventilator began to be
weaned on postoperative day three, and on postoperative day
four, the patient was extubated again.  The Neo-Synephrine
drip was also weaned.

The patient was stable in the Intensive Care Unit, and was
transferred to the floor on [**2120-12-11**], in the evening.
This is now postoperative day seven.  On the floor, he was
slow with ambulation, but eventually improved significantly.
He was tolerating a regular diet, and levofloxacin and
vancomycin were discontinued.  Laboratories were stable, with
a hematocrit of 32.3, white count 5.8, potassium 4.2, BUN 21,
creatinine .7.

Pertinent Results:
[**2182-4-24**] Cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system reveals severe native 3 vessel disease.  The
LMCA has diffuse disease.  The LAD, LCx, and RCA are all
occluded proximally. 2.  Arterial conduit angiography revealed
the LIMA to be widely patent. There is diffuse disease in the
mid-distal LAD distal to the anastamosis.  The is left to rigth
collaterals to the distal PDA.  The SVG to OM is thrombotically
occluded in its proximal segment.  The SVG to PDA has a distal
90% stenosis. 3.  Resting hemodynamic measurement reveals
moderately elevated biventricular filling pressure (with RVEDP
of 18mmHg and mean PCWP of 22mmHg) with moderate pulmonary
hypertension (56/25mmHg). The cardiac output is decreased at
2.2L/min/m2. 4.  Left ventriculography was deferred given the
patient's history of renal insufficiency.
[**2182-4-26**] Chest CT: 1. Prior sternotomy and CABG. Atherosclerotic
calcification of the thoracic aorta, most prominent at the top
of the arch, with minimal calcification of the ascending aorta.
2. Mild pulmonary edema. 3. Two tiny sub- 4 mm pulmonary
nodules. In the absence of a known primary malignancy, 1 year
followup with CT could be performed if the patient has a history
of smoking or other risk factors for lung cancer.
[**2182-4-26**] Echo: Prebypass: There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. LVEF <20%. There is severe global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis which improved somewhat after
pericardial stripping.. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The abdominal aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pericardium appears thickened. Postbypass: patient on epil,
milranone, norepi, phenylehphrine. LV function is unchanged with
an LVEF 20%. There is improved function in the anterior wall,
which is mild to moderately hypokinetic. The remaing walls are
severely hypokinetic. The right ventricle appears mild to
moderately hypokinetic. Aortic contours are intact. IABP is seen
with its tip 2 cm below the left subclavian. Remaining exam is
unchanged.
[**2182-4-30**] LE Art Dup: Findings consistent with acute occlusion of
the common femoral artery and most of the superficial femoral
artery, reconstitution of the distal SFA with low flows,
however.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 72438**] was seen in the cardiac
surgery office and was transferred over to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was
admitted. On [**4-24**] he was brought for a cardiac cath which
revealed severe three vessel disease and occluded vein grafts.
Over the next couple days he received medical management and was
the taken to the operating room on [**2182-4-26**]. The patient on
induction had a bradycardic cardiac arrest and had to be
resuscitated by chest compressions and a bolus of epinephrine to
resuscitate him. Before starting the surgery, in view of the
arrest, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed through the
right femoral artery. After a period of resuscitation, the
patient stabilized and surgery was commenced. He underwent a
redo-sternotomy, coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please see
operative report for details. In view of the poor cardiac
function, cardiac arrest, and multiple drips, the decision was
made to leave the chest open. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring on multiple
inotropes in critical condition. On post-op day one he was taken
back to the operating room where he underwent closure of his
sternotomy. Please see operative report for details. He was then
transferred back to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. He
remained intubated on multiple vasoactive drips and with a
balloon pump. His IABP was weaned successfully and dc'd on POD
#3. He was seen by vascular surgery for a loss of DP/and PT
signals after the IABP was removed, and a heparin gtt was
recommended.  He was taken to the operating room by vascular
surgery on [**4-30**] where he underwent a right femoral thrombectomy
and patch angioplasty. As such, he will require 3 months of
coumadin. He went into afib on [**5-1**] with a drop in BP/SVO2 and
CO, and required cardioversion which was unsuccessful, he was
started on amiodarone. He was seen by infectious diseases for
persistent fever, rising whiwte count and increase in ETT
secretions. Bronchoscopy revealed pneumonia in RUL and LLL,
sputum culture showed gram + cocci and gram negative rods, and
was started on vacomycin and zosyn.He was also found to have a
gram positive bacteremia and rising LFTs. Abdominal ultrasound
was negative. He was extubated on [**5-4**]. Bedside swallow
evaluation showed aspiration and the patient remained NPO. Tube
feeds were started. His creatinine rose but improved with
discontinuation of his lasix gtt. He continued to be followed by
[**Last Name (un) **] at times requiring an insulin drip, his lantus and
sliding scale were increased. He was transferred to the floor on
[**5-9**]. Repeat swallow evaluation on [**5-10**], diet was advanced to
regular with thin liquids. He was seen again by ID on [**5-13**] for
his groin wound, recommendations were to continue Vancomycin for
at least seven days after discharge depending on the state of
his groin.  By [**5-15**] he was ready for discharge to a
rehabilitation facility

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Tiny posterior pericardial effusion. Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
She underwent preoperative workup for cardiac surgery. She had
episode of heart burn with hypotension preoperatively with no
EKG changes and no enzyme changes.  She was then taken to
surgery that morning for coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Please see operative report for further details.  Following
surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring.  In the first twenty four hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On post
operative day one she was started on lopressor and became
bradycardic to 30's requiring pacing.  Lopressor was stopped and
she was monitored in the CVICU.  She no longer required pacing
and rhythm remained stable 70's NSR, betablockers were held and
echocardiogram was unchanged.  She was transferred to the floor
for the remainder of her care.  Physical therapy worked with her
on strength and mobility.  She was started on beta blockers,
which she tolerated.  She was noted to have occaisional periods
of atrial fibrillation and Amiodarone was initiated, she then
had sinus pauses and therefore the Amiodarone was discontinued.
Warfarin therapy was initiated for intermittent atrial
fibrillation with rate control. She was ready for discharge to
rehab on post operative day 6.

Brief Hospital Course:
**MICU Course**
83 y.o. female w/advanced AD, history of DVT, PAF, severe
decubitus ulcers, reccurrent UTI, presents with urosepsis and
afib w/RVR.
.
# Shock. Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for septic
shock, with fever, hypotension and UTI suggesting urosepsis.
Mildly elevated liver enzymes and [**Last Name (un) **] implied that the patient
was found relatively early in her decompensation. Pt was started
on Zosyn, Vanc and was briefly on pressors for the first night
of admission but quickly weaned off with fluid boluses.

# Atrial fibrillation, rapid rate: Pt's afib quickly improved
with fluid boluses and low dose metoprolol for rate control
.

coumadin), severe decubitus ulcers, reccurrent UTI, who presents
with urosepsis and afib w/RVR.
.
# Sepsis: Resolved on transfer to floor. Pt was afebrile during
her wards course. She was transitioned from vancomycin and zosyn
when culture data available for urine - growing ecoli and
providencia stuartii. Continued on vancomycin for HAP and
changed to ceftriaxone for UTI. Broadly covered given her
history of MRSA. Discontinued bactrim for decubitus ulcers that
was started prior to admission. Do not suspect this is nidus for
her sepsis and concerned for potential antibiotic resistance
with long term abx therapy. Blood culture have been negative to
date. Her femoral line was removed and cultured and no growth to
date as well. R picc line was placed for antibiotic
administration, please discontinue after abx completed. She
appears clinically stable for dc to rehab at this time. Plan to
continue antibiotic coverage until [**2188-11-21**] for planned 8 day
coverage.
.
# Afib: Afib w RVR on admission and noted to be in pAfib during
her stay. Was not admitted on any nodal or antihypertensive
agents, currently on coumadin for CHADS of 5. Was
supratherapeutic on admission. TFTs wnl on admission - not cause
of sinus tach. Hemodynamically stabilized in MICU with volume
resuscitation. She was then started on metoprolol tartrate 25mg
[**Hospital1 **] for rate control on [**11-14**] w good result.
*INR is currently therapeutic (goal 2.0-3.0) off coumadin.
Elevated level likely [**1-15**] to cephalosporin interaction. After
discussion with family/HCP daughter decision was made to
continue anticoagulation for recurrent dvts and afib. Plan to
follow with daily INR levels and restart coumadin when INR<2.0.
.
# Sacral decub infections: Present on admission - this has been
chronic problem for her. Listed initially as possible nidus of
infection, although currently appears to be stable. Wound
consult followed pt and made recommendations during her stay -
plan to continue per PAGE1 included in dc planning papers. Pt
was admitted on bactrim therapy for treatment of decubitus ulcer
however this was held during her stay while being treated w
other antibiotics. Do not believe that patient requires
antibiotic coverage at this time for her ulcers.
.
#. Anemia: pt's baseline is unclear but likely around 28-30. She
was guaiac negative during her stay. Post-MICU Hct was noted to
downtrend from 37 (thought to be hemoconcentrated and
artificially elevated) to 20. Unclear etiology for anemia
however it is possible that guaiac screenings did not detect
slow occult bleed. Pt did not exhibit abd pain that would lead
us to suspect RP bleed. She was transfused 2u pRBCs on [**11-15**] for
anemia and responded appropriately. Hct stable at time of
discharge. Plan to check Hct in 5 days or sooner if restarting
coumadin.
.
# DM: continued on insulin ss (humalog).
.
# Aortic Stenosis: TTE was obtained during her stay showing
worsening aortic stenosis. Pt can be followed as an outpt. Felt
to be euvolemic on evaluation after volume resuscitation in MICU
and 1 day of maintenance fluids on wards. Please discuss w PCP.

.
# Advanced AD: severe nonverbal/babbles at baseline. Never
oriented to person, place, or time. She was noted to be a MS
baseline on transfer to the floor, confirmed with HCP.
.
# Goals of care: discussed with daughter on [**11-17**] via phone (HCP
unable to come into hospital). She wishes to treat all acute
medical issues for her mother including anticoagulation for
recurrent DVTs and coumadin ppx for afib.
.
# Recurrent DVTs: Currently holding anticoagulation given
anemia, therapeutic INR and increased risk for bleeding. Pt had
been on anticoagulation for recurrent DVTs and afib (CHADS 5).
Discussed goals of care w her daughter who would ""like
everything done if possible except for CPR and intubation."" She
prefers to continue coumadin even with increased bleeding risk.
Plan to restart coumadin when INR<2.0 with goal 2.0-3.0.
.
# Urinary incontinence: Pt had foley placed for volume
monitoring while inpt - plan to dc at rehab and monitor UO. To
avoid delirium, infection (given multiple admissions for
urosepsis) and atonic bladder complications would recommend
straight catheterizing twice daily at rehab.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2108-9-20**]
Prebypass:
The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is mild global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with estimated Ejection Fraction 50-55%. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch, maximum dimension 0.8 cm.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2108-9-20**] at 1400.
Postbypass:
The patient is AV paced on epinephrine, phenylephrine,
norepinephrine & vasopressin infusions. There is moderate mitral
regurgitation. There is mild tricuspid regurgitation. The
remaining valves are unchanged. Biventricular function is
maintained on multiple agents. There is biatrial enlargement and
bowing of the interatrial septum L->R. The aorta is intact.
Prior to chest closure, biventricular function remains intact on
only norepinephrine & vasopressin infusions. The tricuspid
regurgitation is trace to mild. The mitral regurgitation is now
mild to moderate.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2108-9-19**] where the patient underwent urgent
coronary artery bypass graft times six.  Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein
grafts to posterior descending artery, obtuse marginal 1 and 2,
and diagonal 1 and 2, and Endoscopic harvesting of the long
saphenous vein.  See operative note for full deatils. Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring. Post-operative day one found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
Initially she had no underlying rhythm and remained DDD paced.
The electrophysiology service was consulted.  Lopressor was
initiated once the patient regained her rhythm and she was
tolerating beta blockers with a rate in the 80's.  The patient
was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no
inotropic or vasopressor support. She was gently diuresed toward
the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Mediastinal chest tubes
were removed and the pleural chest tube stayed in an additional
day due to an air leak.  After the pleural chest tube was on
waterseal for greater than twenty-four hours with a small stable
left pneumothorax, pleural chest tube was pulled. Follow up
chest radiograph showed small stable left pneumothorax. Pacing
wires were discontinued without complication on post-operative
day four. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on post-operative day six the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**Doctor First Name 391**] [**Hospital **]
Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
